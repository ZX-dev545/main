51,51,13hlil1,"Title: Enhancing Democratic Participation through a Mobile Application: A Case Study Abstract: This paper presents a case study of a mobile application designed to enhance democratic participation. The application allows users to participate in the democratic process by providing a platform for them to engage in discussions, suggest solutions, and vote on issues at local, state, and federal levels. By leveraging the power of mobile technology, the application promotes transparency, accountability, and civic engagement. The study finds that the application has the potential to increase political efficacy and promote a more informed and engaged citizenry. Introduction: Democratic participation is a cornerstone of modern society. The ability of citizens to participate in the political process is essential to ensuring a healthy democracy. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in democratic participation. This decline is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of trust in political institutions, a sense of political apathy, and the rise of misinformation. This paper presents a case study of a mobile application designed to enhance democratic participation. Methodology: The mobile application was designed to provide users with a platform for engaging in discussions, suggesting solutions, and voting on issues. The application was tested in a small pilot study in which participants were asked to use the application to engage in discussions and vote on local and state-level issues. Participants were also surveyed on their political efficacy and their perceptions of the application's usefulness. Results: The pilot study found that the mobile application had a positive impact on political efficacy. Participants who used the application reported feeling more informed about local and state-level issues, and more confident in their ability to participate in the democratic process. Additionally, participants reported that the application was easy to use and that it provided a valuable platform for civic engagement. Conclusion: The mobile application represents a promising tool for enhancing democratic participation. By leveraging the power of mobile technology, the application provides users with a platform for engaging in discussions, suggesting solutions, and voting on issues at local, state, and federal levels. The application has the potential to increase political efficacy and promote a more informed and engaged citizenry. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impact of the application and to identify ways to improve its effectiveness. However, the results of this pilot study suggest that the application is a valuable tool for enhancing democratic participation. to be used with taxcoin",0

Would you support this? here’s a chatgpt breakdown of such an idea: **taxcoin** 

Certainly! Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the benefits of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported blockchain architecture for integrated tax, financial, tax computation, and reserve monetary compensation: Streamlined Taxation Process: An AI-supported blockchain architecture can automate tax payments and refunds through the use of smart contracts, reducing the administrative burden on taxpayers and tax authorities. This automation can result in more accurate and efficient tax collection. Enhanced Security and Privacy: The use of blockchain technology in tax collection and financial transactions ensures that all transactions are transparent and immutable, reducing the risk of fraud and other financial crimes. Additionally, cryptographic hashing and encryption can be utilized to protect sensitive taxpayer data from unauthorized access or modification. Increased Efficiency: The use of AI in tax collection and financial transactions can help to reduce errors, minimize manual intervention, and improve transaction processing times, resulting in increased efficiency and cost savings. Improved Transparency: The use of distributed ledger technology in tax collection and financial transactions creates an immutable record of all transactions, enabling tax authorities and other stakeholders to easily track and audit tax payments and financial transactions. Reserve Monetary Compensation: An AI-supported blockchain architecture can also support the creation of a reserve monetary system that can help stabilize financial markets during times of economic stress. By leveraging blockchain technology and AI, this reserve system can efficiently and transparently distribute monetary compensation to those in need, helping to stabilize financial markets and protect against economic downturns. Overall, the benefits of an AI-supported blockchain architecture for integrated tax, financial, tax computation, and reserve monetary compensation are numerous. By leveraging these technologies, governments and financial institutions can streamline their operations, reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve transparency and security. User Could the blockchain be used to compute all that distributed data procedurally? ChatGPT Yes, blockchain technology can be used to compute and store distributed data procedurally. In fact, the blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses a network of nodes to store and verify transactions, which can include financial and market data. Each block in the chain contains a hash of the previous block, creating an immutable record that cannot be altered. This makes the blockchain an ideal platform for storing financial and market data, as it provides a secure and transparent way to store and verify transactions. Additionally, blockchain technology can incorporate smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These smart contracts can be used to automate processes and reduce the need for manual intervention, making the computation and processing of distributed data more efficient and accurate.
Title: Blockchain Computing for Efficient Taxation and Beyond: A Comprehensive Overview Abstract: Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to streamline the taxation process by leveraging distributed ledger technology and smart contracts to automate tax payments and refunds, and enhance security and transparency. However, the potential of blockchain computing extends far beyond taxation. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various applications of blockchain technology in the financial industry, including market data scraping, financial data processing, and coin returns, in addition to tax collection and reimbursement. The paper explores the benefits and challenges associated with the implementation of blockchain technology, including its potential to improve efficiency, transparency, security, and privacy. Additionally, the paper examines the potential implications of blockchain technology for financial regulation and policy. Introduction: Blockchain computing technology has the potential to revolutionize the way financial systems operate, improving efficiency, transparency, security, and privacy. Blockchain technology utilizes distributed ledger technology and smart contracts to automate various financial processes, including tax collection and reimbursement, market data scraping, financial data processing, and coin returns. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various applications of blockchain technology in the financial industry, highlighting its benefits and challenges and exploring its potential implications for financial regulation and policy. Applications of Blockchain Technology: Blockchain technology offers a range of applications beyond tax collection and reimbursement. One of the primary applications of blockchain technology is market data scraping, which involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources to provide valuable insights into market trends and opportunities. Blockchain technology can also be used for financial data processing, streamlining complex financial processes such as settlements and clearing, and improving efficiency and transparency. Additionally, blockchain technology can enable coin returns, allowing customers to easily exchange coins for other currencies or commodities. Benefits and Challenges of Blockchain Technology: The implementation of blockchain technology offers various benefits, including improved efficiency, transparency, security, and privacy. Blockchain technology enables the automation of various financial processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of errors. Additionally, the use of distributed ledger technology provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions, enabling easy tracking and auditing of financial processes. However, the implementation of blockchain technology also poses various challenges, including issues related to scalability, interoperability, and regulation. Implications for Financial Regulation and Policy: The implementation of blockchain technology has potential implications for financial regulation and policy. Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and require a shift in regulatory approaches. However, blockchain technology also offers opportunities to improve financial regulation, such as enabling regulators to monitor and enforce compliance more effectively. Conclusion: Blockchain computing technology offers a range of applications in the financial industry, including tax collection and reimbursement, market data scraping, financial data processing, and coin returns. The implementation of blockchain technology offers various benefits, including improved efficiency, transparency, security, and privacy, but also poses various challenges. As the implementation of blockchain technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider its potential implications for financial regulation and policy.",-4

They cannot be innate rights in the sense that you cannot expect to have health care magically endowed to you in the absence of government. Just as well, you cannot expect for a cooperative society to perfectly provide those services to everyone if the means do not exist.

82,82,13hlil1,"Unlikely this will happen anytime soon. I'm not sure either major political party actually wants it. That's why there's so much distraction on meaningless culture wars; to prevent us from fighting the class war. That said, I could almost see the democrats in their current form supporting some advancements that would help get us closer.

**GENERAL**

* Do not entertain ANY cuts to existing safety net programs.
* Revise the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to a reasonable number and set it to adjust with inflation.
* Implement an appropriate federal minimum wage (at least $20 /hr now) and adjust it for inflation.

**FOOD**

* Eliminate SNAP work requirements entirely.
* Boost SNAP benefits by at least 35-50% across the board.
* Eliminate separate requirements for students.
* Fix the way benefits are calculated so that it is proportional to income. Nobody should instantly lose all of their SNAP benefits because they're $1 over the FPL. If you're over the FPL by $x, decrease benefits by $x.

**HEALTHCARE**

I'm not sure what the democrats would be okay with actually pushing for here. I'm a firm believer in universal healthcare, but I know mainstream democrats aren't going to get behind it. Maybe they could accept loosening Medicaid eligibility requirements or a public option as Biden has proposed in the past, while simultaneously continuing to push back on big pharma piecewise (as we've seen with insulin).

**JOBS**

* Invest in transportation infrastructure so people can get to work fast and cheap. High speed rail in California is great, but we still need *basic* transportation hubs in many rural and suburban areas that currently have NOTHING. This also has the added benefit of reducing emissions from cars by reducing the number of cars on the roads.
* Educate people about unions and how to form them. Push for more unions. Do not pass any policy that undermines unions.

Obviously we need a lot more than this. These are just ideas I can at least see the democrats being willing to consider.",1

Just a bit of what got me started on  how far to trust Bernie though.

How [does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans:](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/)

* **I added the bold becasue Bernie has many people assuming these funding sources will go away**
-----

Medicare for All by Bernie was estimated to have a 10 Year $47 trillion Total Costs.  And to pay for it

* Current federal, state and local government spending over the next ten years is projected to total about $30 trillion of that.
* The Tax Revenue options Bernie has proposed total $17.5 Trillion
 * $30 trillion  + $17.5 trillion = $47.5 Trillion Total Funding

-----

The source he lists, National Health Expenditure Projections 2018-2027,  says The $30 Trillion is 

* Medicare $10.6 Trillion (No change to FICA means still deficit spending)
 *  $3.7 Trillion is funded by the Medicare Tax.  
 * **$7 Trillion is Income Tax and Medicare Beneficiary Premiums Payments** 
     * Medicare for the Aged is in fact not free. Payments by those over 65 who enroll in Medicare for age eligibility,  so anyone over 65 pays a monthly premium plus out of pocket.  (Much less than most of course) 
     * Medicare for All (Excluding the Aged) is supposed to be free.  It includes no revenue from Premiums for Medicare recipients not over 65
* Medicaid Taxes $7.7 Trillion
* **current Out of pocket payments $4.8 Trillion**
 * The Out of Pocket Expenses, the money you pay for a  Co-Pay or Prescription will still be paid in to the Medicare for All Funding System

**$6.8  Trillion is uncertain funding** including 

* other **private revenues** are $2 Trillion of this Not Federal Spending
  * this is in **Charity Funding provided philanthropically**. So even though everyone now has Healthcare will these Charities Donate to the hospital or the government still. Can Hospitals accept donations or does it all go to Medicare for central distributions 
  * the money people current donate to places like the Shriners Hospital or St Jude
* workers' compensation insurance premiums, Not Federal Spending
* State general assistance funding, Not Federal Spending
* other state and local programs, and school health. Not Federal Spending
* Indian Health Service,
* maternal and child health, 
* vocational rehabilitation,
* other federal programs,
* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,

It appears left out of that was Children's Health Insurance Program (Titles XIX and XXI), Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans' Affairs.

-----

Plus new taxes

* 4 percent income-based premium
 * $3.9 Trillion
* Imposing a 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers,
 * $5.2 Trillion
* Eliminating health tax expenditures, New Corporate Taxes.
 * $3 Trillion
* Raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52% on income over $10 million.
 * $700 Billion
* Replacing the cap on the state and local tax deduction with an overall dollar cap of $50,000 for a married couple on all itemized deductions.
 * $400 Billion
* Taxing capital gains at the same rates as income from wages and other High Income Taxing
 * $4 Trillion

The Estimated Tax Revenue is over stated, and that's not even the worst issue",0

Billionaires/oligarchs/kleptocrats have an enormous amount of unaccountable political power that they use to bully the public into working for their profits, before even a single penny is spent on formal political campaigns.

If my vitals are being uploaded to my PCP, they can be alerted immediately to any changes in my health).  The point is not to visit a doctor when you are sick.  That’s the old way of doing medicine.  The new way is to focus on prevention and to see a doctor when you are healthy.  It puts more of an emphasis on wellness with the patient, and incentivizes them to take part in the narrative of health.  

The doctor is only there if you need them; they aren’t the end all and be all of patient care.   Having access to medicine is wonderful, but at the end of the day, we all have to change our lifestyle and take responsibility for our health.  Those that do should be rewarded with lower costs.  Those that can’t, for reasons beyond their control, shouldn’t be penalized.

We also know that the costs of prescription drugs can be greatly reduced by having the federal government produce them.  The problem isn’t public outlays, it’s private companies exploiting patients with exorbitant costs to generate profits.

This is significantly different from ""the right to housing"", at least in the way most people seem to be discussing it (that people should be provided with housing or healthcare beyond they can provide for themselves).

As for the rest- well, same thing there. But to the extent you want to create a negative right that limits the government's ability to interfere with the housing people already have, that would be something I could support more. (But doesn't seem to be what advocates are proposing.)

As for lawyers- I'm not sure that follows unless you had a very explicit constitutional amendment that specified an absolute right to have one present in those cases. We already have a situation where you always have a right to consult with a lawyer if you want and can get one, but access to one is only provided in criminal matters not civil matters. This would be a civil matter. And that criminal provision only exists because of an explicit constitutional clause.

But where the courts might go with it is pure speculation. Courts might uphold the laws against too small housing because they could find that it was within the legislature's purvue to define the floor for ""needs"". Inadequate housing fails to provide what the right demands and ties up land preventing it from being used for adequate housing, thus it violates the right to have someone living there.

The rent and landlord issues- that an interaction between two different rights and you cannot have a solution that violates the property rights of the owner. There may be situations where a sharp increase in rent is justified and much more likely the courts could find rent control as unconstitutional - because it results in that kind of sharp increase so a more frequent smaller increase should be the norm. So long as the landlord can find someone else willing to pay that higher rent, such that the housing remains occupied, the housing is being used and it would demonstrate that this particular housing unit has a value that is above average, which would indicate it well beyond ""needs"". Which means the occupant does don't have a right to such a unit. They can move down to a more basic apartment that they can afford. The fact they *want* to stay for stability or *want* to be closer to work or *want* closed door bedrooms for every two people in the family isn't protected by the right. Interfering with the property rights of the owner by decreasing the revenue of landlords limits the amount of funds that housing developers have access to which slows and limits their ability to expand and build additional housing units- which interferes with the ability to provide for the right due to a resulting lack of housing units, therefore landlords should be able to charge market rates up to what they are able to get.
Courts could find that.

Legislature and courts could deem tentage inadequate making police raids on encampments totally legitimate. They could raid the camps and haul those people off to government provides dormitories that meet basic needs- 6x8 foot heated room with bunk bed for two people, access to a common shower and toilets, and cafeteria style eating area. Of course it should also have safety features like low, breakaway shower heads you cannot hang yourself on, furniture bolted to the floor to prevent risk when fights between residents break out, security limits on what possessions can be brought into these communal homes, windows that don't open far enough for anyone to fall out, regular health inspections. 

As for ADA type conversion. If it's a positive right then we back to the issue of forcing others to pay for providing what you ""need"". Of it's only a negative right- do we have any issue with that now? We already have laws preventing the government from not allowing a conversion. I guess you could elevate it to Constitutional instead of statutory. But is it really a need? Courts could limit all kinds of adaptive upgrades as being wants and not needs. Especially if you try to make being provides with housing a positive right. The government needs to manage costs across meeting *everyone's* needs. Providing accessibility beyond the very bare minimum cuts into the ability to provide other with basic housing. You don't *need* lower counters and accessable cabinets - you just need a roommate who can do things for you so we will meet the need by placement in a shared two or four person unit.

Bottom line- a lot of advocates are discussing right to housing as making sure everyone is given a basic housing regardless of their ability to pay. If you want to redefine that and offer up a negative right that only relates to limitations on government, it needs to be much more explicitly defined, probably won't have as much support, and is prone to its own set of problems.",-1

> Why shouldn't a human have the right to a ""normal"" life?

Why shouldn't we all have massive mansions with pools by that logic? Because scarcity of resources is a thing. There simply isn't enough real estate in desirable areas to cater to the whims of every homeless person who wants to live there. Maybe more housing should be built (I'd say so), but are we now asking the government to build high rises using eminent domain? Are we asking the government to build more McMansions with big lawns in far away suburbs? Where is this magical housing coming from? Who owns the land? Who pays for the construction? Who maintains the building? What happens when homeowners complain that property prices are falling due to free housing? (I'd say this is fine, but it's a concern for elected officials)

I really don't have anything against giving out dorm rooms. Hell, it's probably a reasonable thing in cities with empty commercial real estate, and I'm not sure why it's not implemented on a wide scale. But what frivolity people want isn't the basis for what a ""bill of rights"" should be based on. And that's the problem with these bullshit ideas, especially on Reddit- reality is ignored for whatever nonsense looks good on an internet comment.

To not be fascists, we need a government that:

- protects economic working class interests and not corporate interests
- we don't reduce everyone and everything to friends and enemies
- reduce any legitimacy of the press or suppress criticism
- values disagreement and dissent
- does not deny truth or minimize it 
- does not use propaganda and propagate conspiracies 
- does not deny the rule of law or seek to delegitimize courts 
- does not politicize public service 
- does not fearmonger against identifiable groups 
- does not take action for action's sake 
- does not engage in surveillance
- does not indulge in depicting pacifism as trafficking with the enemy
- does not engage in denial or diminishment of rights and freedoms


and so on. Both of the parties are full of these kinds of things and both are leaning into it, hard. You can go through the Ur-Fascism list and itemize each of these to an individual party as an exercise.

Food wadte is everywhere because of capitalism. Farmers literally throw away tons of crops since they make money from subsidies for just growing them. They dont even have to sell them to make profit. So food is not a limitation at all. Super easy to provide enough for everyone. 

Housing is a bit more difficult since it is location dependent as you mentioned. Nyc has limited space for instance so not everyone can get free housing there. This would take a lot of city planning but basically making government subsidied housing areas. Every city goes through zoning already for how kuch residential/industry/commercial areas it needs. A city should have a certain % of the residential be ""free"" based on the avg poverty level of the city and how much free housing is needed. If there is more poor ppl than zoning can fit (ie paid housing is getting too limited and real estate prices are skyrocketing) then they will have to move to the next nearest area. So yes, 300 mill people cant live in nyc for free. There are practical concerns. So yeah there will probably still be some homeless ppl who dont want to move. Thats just logistics. 

None of this is that difficult. Other countries have done versions of it and are doing it fine. Were not city planners/politicians.

- if you’re struggling with broken sleep, nothing will improve your health more than fixing it. This sub is about fixing breathing problems for sleep. If that applies to you, post again with what that looks like. 

- humans changed from direct democracy to representative democracy because there were simply too many things to track.

1290,1290,18lbmo0,What does this have to do with low carb?,13
1291,1291,18lbmo0,"I will be up front that I've been through grad school and I work in the sciences, so that's where my viewpoint comes from.  

That said, though, you are right-- science does change! And sometimes conflicts of interest do inject themselves into research.  That's why peer review is so important, and why repeating studies is so valuable.

I try to take any research I find with a grain of salt and look at it in the context of the body of research surrounding the study-- was this a one-off study? Are there other studies that have found similar results from different researchers? Are there studies that refute their findings, and if so, how repeatable were those?

I'm also fortunate to be well versed in reporting technical results, so I will often look into the methodology and significance of the reported findings.  One thing that's good to always check is sample size, or the number of subjects that participated in the study. Another thing to look at is how the data was collected.  Self-reported data can be questionable and sometimes unreliable, but sometimes it's the only way to get the data needed.  There's a lot more to be said here, and it doesn't instantly mean that results are good or bad, it's just something to consider.

Part of a doctor's job is to keep themselves updated with advancements in medical research, but sometimes they don't do that, or they let their personal biases and beliefs influence how they take in and apply that information.  Sometimes the medical research is pointing a certain way, and they will adjust their practice to conform to that, while other times they may not want to change their practice until there is more evidence.  Doctors are people, too, and they make decisions based on what they think is best all the time, but sometimes that means you have to advocate for yourself if they don't happen to align with your situation.  That said, they will push back against things that they believe or know to be detrimental, and sometimes very rightly.

In science, we live with a little bit of ambivalency at all times.  Some people are uncomfortable with that and see it as weakness and indecisiveness, so instead they seek the confidence of dissenting voices.  It's easy to be confident when you don't know what you don't know.

In the context of low carb, which I believe is the reason you posted here, there are certainly medical professionals and researchers alike who do not feel that the evidence is supportive for a low-carb lifestyle.  The good news is that the body of research continues to advance and grow, and more doctors are seeing the real-world implications of food and lifestyle changes in their own patients.  The bad news is that many medical systems are built around treating symptoms rather than finding root causes, because investigating a problem deeply often requires more time and resources than many systems allow for.  Money is a huge factor.",7
1292,1292,18lbmo0,"Dr Bernstein. Learn about him. Read his book. 

He cured his peripheral neuropathy at a time when people weren't interested I'm hearing about low carb diets. He is/was the oldest type 1 alive that we know of. 

After collecting data forever He was poopoo'd by the establishment. They said he wasn't a physician, what could he know. 

So he became one. And opened shop in NY state. 

Wrote a book. Had a website full of militant lowcarb diabetics.",1
1293,1293,18lbmo0,"You need to figure out how to determine reputable sources, first off. The government is not necessarily a reputable source because of lobbyists. Some scientists work for schools and research for passion through grant money and their own fundraising (so more independent to research); some are being paid directly by corporations with heavy interest, so they _could_ be swayed. But not necessarily. 

Which brings me to my next point: you need some basic science literacy, again from reputable sources. (Not randos online.) You need to understand how scientific studies should be structured to know if a study is good or not. I learned all of this in high school, maybe some textbooks could help. Basically, if you’re reading about an experiment, you need to be able to ascertain a few things:
- are the results actually attributable to what they claim? This has to do with structure. Like, if they change more than one variable, for example, you can’t say variable A is responsible if you also changed variable B. 
- can you scale that result up? If they tested dietary changes for a week, or on a different species, can you then say with confidence that the same results would hold true if studied in humans or long term
- are the results what they say they are? Say it’s a study about weight loss and they are claiming huge losses kept off. How much weight did participants actually lose? And how long did it stay off? 

There’s a lot more to science literacy but it’s absolutely critical to being able to do any of your own research.

Finally, understanding that true conspiracy is rare and nearly impossible at large scale. Someone will always leak the info the bigger the conspiracy is. Some things, like addictive food engineering, is less conspiracy and more neglect and greed. Pharma is rarely a conspiracy; it’s just again about caring more about making money than about people. But that happens in the executive offices more than in the labs; there can be both greed and rigorous science coexisting. Just follow the money for weaknesses.",1
1294,1294,18lbmcu,"I like this post. Thanks! 

I am a total centrist when it comes to health. I am also a scientist-clinician myself which perhaps gives me the ability to be a centrist. Furthermore, my work is in the perceptual/physiology field which may even give me a bigger upper hand on placebo and human behavior. I am lucky because I have access to any journal in the world through work and am used to reading lots of technical work. 

I don’t believe everything I see. I am actually immediately skeptical of anything until I see data on a double blinded study. I am NOT skeptical of the FDA or pharmaceutical companies because the FDA is just doing their job and pharmaceutical companies are doing their job which is selling. The thing is that it takes a very discerning eye to ask the right questions about data. I can make anything make sense and look good, but if you know nothing about the subject matter you would never know to pick it apart. 

For me, I personally hold myself accountable for doing the things in the instruction manual: I don’t drink or use drugs, I exercise at least five days a week, my BP-BMI-cholesterol are all normal because of behavior, I see a therapist, etc… 

The most important thing, and this comes down to major barriers to good healthcare, is that I find a PCP that I trust and can speak on the same level. This has been gold. Too many people I see don’t trust their provider and therefore get shitty care. In turn, they blame the provider not realizing that they perhaps didn’t follow through and do their part like schedule regular physicals and adhere to the instructions on the manual (stated above). 

As far as supplements and all the other jazz… I believe most of it is placebo. I certainly take my fair share, and I am aware that it might be placebo. The thing is is that placebo actually works! We have proven this over and over again in science. 

What makes  good scientist? The ability to change one’s mind when presented with contrary evidence. This not only makes a good scientist this just makes a good person. 

Like I tell my dad who is so sure that he can fix all of his health problems and would much rather take something off of the health food store shelf that he prescribed for himself rather than listen to any doctors recommendation: 

1) If nothing changes, nothing changes. 

2) If you think it works. Do it x1000.",1

I know what you mean. One thing that pisses me off is how many places talk shit about their authentic slow and low pit BBQ and then have visible commercial smokers. I'm not sure the understand what pit smoked means.

This is my main gripe. It seems very difficult to do BBQ correctly with the limitations of the NYC restaurant biz. BBQ is already a business with razor thin proft margins that requires intense micromanagement and high levels of rolling meat off and on.

1775,1775,26p7gi,"Maybe, just maybe requiring a college degree for every single good job is not the best idea. Part of the reason they are becoming relatively useless is that jobs that didn't require degrees in the past now require them for entry level positions. One of the bizarre things I encountered during the apex of the crisis was being required a Bachellor's in accounting to work as an office clerk at an accounting firm. The same job I had seven years earlier in the summer between junior and senior year of high school.",251
1776,1776,26p7gi,"The new American life: Enter into tens of thousands of dollars of debt to get an education.  Live frugally for a decade (at least) while you pay it off, potentially going into more debt along the way.  Try and tuck away whatever you can into a 401k so you have a chance at a modest retirement (if you don't happen to retire during a market collapse), then go into more debt to own a house, which you will pay off for the rest of your life.  Every step of the way, bankers and financiers make big money on interest payments and management fees.  Oh, and pay big federal taxes, state taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, various city fees, HOA fees - just bleed money your whole life.  Oh, but don't forget, you also need to pay for insurance on basically every physical asset you *don't even own*.  Car?  Need insurance.  Rent?  Need insurance.  Own a home?  Need insurance.  Can't put 20% down?  Need insurance.  Life is hard - stay in school kids.  ",350

What could go wrong?  ",81
1778,1778,26p7gi,"When anyone can get a student loan, schools know they can charge anything.

1779,1779,26p7gi,Most of the college degrees are worthless. Even STEM fields are getting saturated. The american dream of being able to afford your own house and pay it off within 2 decades is gone for a large percentage of our population now.,24

1781,1781,26p7gi,"I wonder how much the worth of a degree has fallen in the same time period. I'm not even sure it has fallen, but I wouldn't be surprised. These growth rates are unsustainable, however you slice it. ",37
1782,1782,26p7gi,I still can't wrap my head around how this bubble ends since there is no asset that can be taken away.  The asset is in the form of a shitty watered down education and having a trove of eligible works riddled with debt.  The only thing I can think is that this whole bubble will make the majority of colleges lose reputation while the prestigious institutions remain the social divisor in deciding who gets the good jobs and who doesn't.  Will some universities have their credibility and status  lowered down to that of a community college?,50
1783,1783,26p7gi,"A MASSIVE more less-spoken about negative side-effect of the education debt bubble here is the overall negative side-effect on the US economy from it due to how much money is being spent on paying down debt and interest on the debt rather than injecting it back into the economy.

For many people, college debt is very similar in size to a mortgage on a home, or at least a small home.  This completely delays their ability to start building personal worth and assets and instead, they are forced to ""RENT"" at a higher price.  This is driving more and more people into renting rather than buying, and thus overall raising the demand for renting units, and overall increasing the price it costs everyone to rent and as a result, hurting even further the lower middle class and poor people in this country who are the typical renters.  All that extra money being spent on student loan payments, plus a higher cost rent, is actually taking money from what previous generations' college graduates would be spending and boosting the economy with.

It's a sad sad state that they do not want to accept.  Reality of the situation is this though, colleges and universities that keep increasing tuition, lock in step with gov't Financial Aid and loan allowment increasements each year or other year, are no different in management than the greedy banks on wallstreet that are responsible for the 2008 economic collapse.

We can especially blame our government and leadership for essentially having created an environment where this was allowed to happen, with no serious push-back.

A whole new generation will be saddled with debt and delayed 10-15 years, in an economy that isn't nearly as lucrative for previous generation college grads... it really is depressing when you think of it.",31
1784,1784,26p7gi,"The saddest part is that students are going into debt, and still not able to get good paying jobs when they graduate.  I'm one of them.  I graduated in 2008 and have struggled to make my way with under $30,000 a year.  I used to process applications for the Head Start program (pre K for low income folks, meant to give the child a boost in education with the hope it will help break the cycle of poverty).  Over half of the applications that I got were people who had Bachelor's degrees but were still unemployed.  The other half were likely illegal immigrants who found work in blue collar jobs, many times making more than me having a degree.  It's really maddening. Also, the underpaid workers rallying to raise minimum wage to $15 and hour...I say do it.  I will go to work at McDonald's. Maybe then I can afford to pay back my student loans.",39
1785,1785,26p7gi,"Wonder where the money goes?  

""Forty years ago, America’s colleges employed more professors than administrators. The efforts of 446,830 professors were supported by 268,952 administrators and staffers. Over the past four decades, though, the number of full-time professors or “full-time equivalents”—that is, slots filled by two or more part-time faculty members whose combined hours equal those of a full-timer—increased slightly more than 50 percent. That percentage is comparable to the growth in student enrollments during the same time period. But the number of administrators and administrative staffers employed by those schools increased by an astonishing 85 percent and 240 percent, respectively.""

1786,1786,26p7gi,"So sad

I grew up in the 60s. We believed in progress, it really looked like the world was getting better

I attended UCSD in the early 70s. Excellent education at a reasonable price

Why did we throw it all away?

So sad",22
1787,1787,26p7gi,"My family has been middle class or lower my entire life. Not much savings or investments. Immigrant parents. 

I went to college on scholarship and owed nothing. I was graduating in a bad year job wise, so I went for a doctorate degree at a private school. My parents didn't and couldn't help me with tuition so I took out lots of loans (180k). I recently graduated after four years and now make in the 150k range. Now this may get down voted to oblivion here since others have it much worse... but my average interest rate is 7.5%. It's worrisome not because I don't think I can't pay if off because I will but because I am now considered the ""rich"" for tax purposes and get no write offs. How can young people like me spend money when there is this much anxiety provoking loan balances floating around


 I am able to gamble with my a margin brokerage account at about the same rate and those losses can be written off. In what sane country are students who go for more education punished. Default rates in the medical profession are low. My monthly loan payment is $2300 so I live as frugally as I did in college. Income based repayment is a losing proposition for me, so I try to make over payments when I can. My current net worth is -200k. I understand that there's people that have it worse than me, and I feel bad for them. But I sacrificed 4 years (plus one year of unpaid internship) of not working (opportunity cost). Long term I will be fine, but I am in no way going to have much disposable income for a while. 


I am not complaining, but just pointing out that to improve your odds of a good life with more school will cost you a lot. This cost is not slowing down either. You're best bet is to be born rich. The government seems to not care about graduate students based on their actions (recent talk about capping PSLF loan forgiveness for those who took on lower salaries to aid the underprivileged). This strike talks about double digit interest rates as well



 My classmates who have rich parents have no loans or they borrow against their assets at a much lower rate. It's already happening but the middle class is fading away for good. If you work hard to attend graduate school you will be knee deep in debt. If you decide to work out of college, odds are stacked against you. ",9

1798,1798,26p7gi,"A large part of the reason that college has increased so much IS financial aid. 

Colleges can charge more because more students have access to funding and because more students stay in school longer because they can.

Aid should be tied to a university only raising the cost of tuition a certain percentage a year. Also, aid should be limited in years for a student per degree. You should not be able to get financial aid for 8 years for a BA.

Also, there should be a cap on the amount of loans a student can receive over the quantity that the school will receive. Too many students take max loans just so they can get a 3000-4000 refund from their schools.

Finally, I believe that aid recipients should be required to do some community services. Nothing that will hold burden the student, but something. Think of how much good could be done if every student receiving aid does just 20 hours a semester?",60

Easy to get government subsidized loans.

Equals a huge increase in the number of people seeking a somewhat finite product, and the ability to charge nearly anything they want for it.

Of course the price of college has gone up, because everyone can put themselves in debt for 50 years to go instead of paying their way or only going to a few classes related specifically to their vocation.

I bet a similar study would show an even larger jump in the price of a high school diploma since 1979 as well (if you include public school per student price).",5

1803,1803,26p7gi,"MANY caveats and points to be made here.

More and more people are going to college under the idea/false promise of higher wages/better career. In the 70's & 80's only like 30% of young people had an undergraduate degree or better, now its over 50%. Increase demand means higher price.

In many product & service industries like food (as used in title) can have their costs dramatically lowered by more efficient means of production; education main cost is labor & short of paying your labor (professors) less (sort of killing your goal by lowering wages of those you are promising good wages to), it is difficult to ""trim the fat"" of most legitimate educational institutions.

Enter, the for-profit colleges. These mangily messes promise the product  of their progenitors (good jobs) while actually rarely demonstrating their ability to deliver.  Frontline did a great piece on these which I will just leave at; not worth your time & money. If you didn't get the grades to go to a university with a historical record of getting people good jobs, you probably should examine what you are actually trying to do with continuing your education.

Lastly, while I feel greatly for millennials, at least you still have time to fight back & restore the middle class. Gen X'ers are caught in similar depleting middle class trap & many are greatly in debt, trying to pay for THEIR kids college AND have no savings for their impending retirement. That flat lining of the middle class did not start with the Millennials, it stretches back to the 80's. You are just latest headline.",6

You'd be amazed at the amount of maturity you gain from 18 to 19, etc.  By 22, you will look back at your 18 y/o self as a shell of your newfound wisdom.  If you are going to spend the big bucks, watch yourself carefully.  You'll be graduating into a much harsher US society than you're going to expect.

Remember also that a huge part of this 1000% increase is directly due top the wonderful programs offered by these same institutions of higher learning.  Those fancy dorms, gyms, great art programs, 5x restaurants with different cuisine, unlimited meals, and a likely 1 to 5 or 1 to 4 administrator to student ratio, all of this costs a metric ton of cash.  Colleges will tell you how vastly important they are to your overall development.  

It is all 100% pure horse manure.

You don't need college.  You want to learn, look up the countless online curriculums that are now available from leading institutions.

Want law / get an internship first / get a 3.6 plus GPA and do well on your LSAT / you're good

Medicine / well rounded / character super important / when go for it / be super ready.  I don't care if you want to be 26 and the world's greatest orthopedic surgeon / you're a young god-damn fool.  no one is going to take you seriously until you're 35 at the earliest.  build solid foundations, travel, learn languages, study abroad, you won't be able to do this again until you're 55-60.  build a serious foundation and be emotionally ready before you embark on any medical course. 

Code, programming, web / academia holds you back.  Excluding MIT, Caltech, Stamford, I don't give a damn about your degree.  I want to know what you can do.  I'll take a 14 y/o from Uruguay over you any day because damnit, they don't carry that entitlement that you and I were both raised with.  Prove yourself by doing real world projects, over and over and over again.

Literature, drama, arts, anything liberal, what are you thinking?  unless you are going for academia, get your feet wet, get internships, get minimum wage, get to work in the field of your interest.

In our group, we don't fire people.  Once you're through the door, we do everything we possibly can to force your growth as a human being.  when you elect to stop growing, you walk out the door / but it's your choice.

in this life, you get two major chances to do great things.  the first chance, most people squander.  Get serious and understand the sacrifices, your own mortality, build deep and lasting relationships with people 5, 10, 20, 30 years older than you, spend time with them / listen to them.  and for heaven's sake, self-learning is the end-all-be-all.

Similar things happened with Animal research and Animal Care and Use Committees.  Suddenly we go from not needing any internal regulatory oversight to needing a large degree of it, which again, requires a sizeable support staff to process applications.

[Why It Can Take Six Years to Fire an Inappropriate or Ineffective Teacher](http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/307)

>According to a recent article in Newsweek, few inept teachers are ever dismissed from their positions. In 2008, New York fired three out of 30,000 tenured teachers for just cause. In Chicago, the number of teachers dismissed for poor performance between 2005 and 2008 was 0.1 percent. During that same time frame, Toledo, Ohio, dismissed just .01 percent, and Akron, Ohio and Denver, Colorado did not dismiss any. Instead of getting rid of poor performers, principals try to shuffle them into other schools and districts – a process known as the ""dance of the lemons"" by many schools today.


2) Every idiot and his dog blames ""Reaganomics"", the Koch brothers, or some other right wing punching bang, thanks in part to things like 1., where those teaching the next generation make sure to impart on them viewpoints that help them maintain their cushy arrangements.

Entry level jobs for people with science degrees are often no more than $15 p/hr. and are very competitive and limited right now.  The overabundance of science graduates is such a problem now that more than half of them are finding jobs outside of the science world because they can't find lab positions.

Also, a HUGE problem is that in the science world, a B.S. is just not enough to run a lab.  You just don't have the knowledge and expertise at that point to manufacture new experiments.  You HAVE to have a masters.  Well guess what, how many people with a B.S. are able to actually get into graduate school?  Science graduate positions are extremely competitive, more so than ever.  Also, with the globalization of the world, the graduate field is getting completely inundated by foreign students (mainly Chinese and Indian) that the US students must now compete against for positions for graduate placement.  To put this into perspective... in 1996, in China, there were less than 1 million new University students, and in 2006 there were 5 million.  As of last year, China had almost 15 million new University students.

While America's public education for grade school might be lacking on the world scene, the graduate programs of the US are still the best in the world and what happens is the best of the best, the cream of the crop from India and China are now added to the pool of people applying for those oh so limited science graduate positions making it that much harder.

All I am saying is very few Americans, laden with debt, are able to break into grad school and thus end up into a higher paying field of science, and as such are getting stuck in menial lab work that a previous generation would have been given to lab techs that had taken maybe a 1 semester certificate course to land that position.

Not only that, but there's a wide variation in cost. When I went to school in Texas in the late 1970s, it cost $50 per semester hour, or $1,500 per year for a class load of 15 hours. I was easily able to pay that using work study money. That would be about $4,900 adjusted for inflation. In 1985 the state increased tutition to $140 per semester hour, which works out to $4,200 per year, which becomes $9,300 when adjusted for inflation. But today tuition only costs $7,800 per year at UNT, or $11,800 at UTD.

So it's still more expensive relative to when I went, but relative to those who were unlucky enough to be 5 years older than me it's not that much more expensive if you go to UTD and less expensive if you go to UNT.

The main difference in the cost of my education was the amount the state of Texas was willing to subsidize. If they had continued to subsidize at a steady rate, college tuition would have remained steady, and today would cost less than $5,000 per year.",2

2365,2365,26p7gi,">Colleges are hiring more staff. Student-to-teacher ratio is one of the most heralded numbers in the industry. At a state school charging $10K with an 8:1 student to teacher ratio, it's not hard to imagine the price being about right. Also, have you been to a college campus recently? They are always under construction, making the next big dorm or building or gym.

Your tuition at most major universities is NOT going towards professor salaries. They are getting paid through the grants for their research. 

Tuition is going toward administration and support staff (IT, facilities management, housing and dining to make up for those who don't live on campus). The chancellor of UCSD for example, makes over $400 grand a year. A helpdesk rep makes roughly $54k a year base. HELPDESK as in TECH SUPPORT, a $13/hr job with most major ISP's! This is not unusual. It also gets worse over time as redundant and unnecessary administrative positions are created to justify increasing costs. 

There is also never an 8:1 student ratio, you don't even get that in primary/secondary education. The numbers are usually several hundred students per actual instructor in a public school. It's also never a factor in deciding costs.

> The easy availability of loans and financial aid has enabled schools to charge more. By increasing the availability of loans, the government is creating a bigger demand for higher education; when demand increases, so does price.

2 things on this one:
Increase in prices comes before increase in loan size. Your loan size is determined by the state and university you are attending, aside from personal factors. So if the universities all jack up their prices for the next year, the amount you will get approved for will increase to match.

It is not actually easy to get loans. You, or your parents if you're dependent, make too much money you get hardly any loans. I made ~$27k in the year before starting school, which living in San Diego is just slightly to the right of the poverty line, I only qualified for $3500 between both loans. Now I make $13k a year taxable income, and can get $14k for the year.",1

This is certainly not the answer. Everyone deserves a chance to learn whatever the hell they want, regardless of their parents credit score or financial circumstances.

If a high school diploma is not adequate preparation for our youth to enter the workforce, then we need to provide them with whatever else they need.

Deciding who can get an education, find quality work, afford to raise a family, and pursue happiness in general based on factors external to the student is like spitting in the face of the statue of liberty.

Everyone should have an equal chance.

For instance, a lender could lower the minimum payment so that the loan is essentially paid off over a very long period of time, costing the borrower far more in interest payments than they should have to bear.  It's important to remember that most people rarely understand the financial dynamics involved and make minimum loan payments alone, oblivious to what those ""minimum payments"" cost them over the long haul.

My 2013 Versa (I know, not some amazing car by any stretch, but it's reliable and affordable) cost $15,500 brand new. I looked on carsoup and the same car in the 2013 model is around $12,000 at the cheapest for typically more mileage than I have on my car.

2549,2549,26p7gi,"The typical $25,000 in debt is nothing compared to the $500,000 (present-value adjusted) benefit of attending college, though. It has practically no effect on whether college is a smart play, analyzed from the perspective of a long-term investment.

And it's not like the $500,000 difference is disappearing. The article points out that it is growing, suggesting that the new economy that current college attendees enter into places an even higher premium on a 4-year degree than it used to. Admittedly, this could be caused by very funny distributions in income, where recent grads have little to no income disparity vs. non-grads and older college grads have a very large growing disparity to make up for it. But if that were the case, I don't think we'd see that  the ""unemployment rate in April for people between 25 and 34 years old with a bachelor’s degree was a mere 3 percent."" (from the Nytimes article, vs. a total 25-34 average of [6.6%](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/unemployment/demographics/)) 

If we attempt to homogenize the data (like you suggest) and compare recent grads earnings to previous generations first few years after college, we wouldn't see a full career path. Many jobs start with high pay and ramp up less (engineers) while others have the opposite trend (lawyers). A shift of workers between those fields could mislead you in interpreting the data for this issue. Looking solely at the first few years after college would require correcting for distribution of workers into those respective fields, along with a host of other assumptions about long-term income potential, which makes for a much messier analysis with more room for error. I'm not at all convinced that it would be a better approach to the question and it would definitely require a lot more careful data collection and expensive work.

>Contracts are not ""your word"". Contracts are a best case codified agreement between two or more parties. Contracts are broken ALL THE TIME in business. Breaking the contract simply means that remediation or compensations are in order (if possible). Usually this is done without even involving a court. It is not a proxy for your honor or whatever  moral value you seem to have given it.

If you look at it that way, what reason is there to not break any contract ever as soon as you feel its too laborious for you to honor your end of it? Some people actually do value their name being clear and honoring their part of a deal. 

>What makes student loans disturbing is that unlike every other contract in the United States (that I know of at least), they cannot be broken. This means that the debtor has no effective leverage against the debtee.

2732,2732,26p7gi,"I understand student loans *very* well. I owe 72K myself. 

Most loans are federal. They only compound (also called capitalization) when you enter repayment. Let's say you've borrowed 40K for school and over 4 years, 6K has accrued in interest. When you begin repayment, that 6K will be added to the 40K and your repayment plan will be based on your borrowing 46K. That's the extent of compounding. 

> For instance, a lender could lower the minimum payment so that the loan is essentially paid off over a very long period of time, costing the borrower far more in interest payments than they should have to bear.

The borrower should instruct the lender to apply payments to principal after accrued interest has been paid. Federal loans do this automatically. I'm not aware of any private lender that randomly lowers your minimum payment. *You* pick which payment plan you want. 

> It's important to remember that most people rarely understand the financial dynamics involved and make minimum loan payments alone, oblivious to what those ""minimum payments"" cost them over the long haul.

Isn't that their choice? Minimum payments might cost more over the long run, but it also provides flexibility and improves their monthly cashflow. Important when you're just starting an entry level job. 

> Another way such loans can become burdensome is by jacking up the amount of principal that is borrowed. I tend to fault university administrators, who routinely mismanage their institutions by ignoring the economic impact of their cost structure, for this aspect of oppressive student loans.

Easy to get student loans at relatively low interest rates are one of the very reasons colleges charge so much in the first place. Colleges tell you exactly how much they cost. People need to be choosing colleges they can afford, not private schools (without scholarships) and not out of state. 

I almost went out of state but I would have had to borrow 100K+ to go there. Instead I went in state and lived at home. A decent chunk of my loans are also irresponsible spending like bars. I'm sure many borrowers did the same thing. ",1

Too often, things like finance, health costs, etc.. are never brought up or openly spoken about in family life.  Making young people aware of these issues and the personal struggles involved is what will lead to an educated youth entering the workforce.

Then ship them to yet another ""educational"" day-care, but now the individual becomes their own authority, and decision maker; left to their own devices with little more than a ""good luck"" from the finance office of a college/university.

2811,2811,26p7gi,"> If you look at it that way, what reason is there to not break any contract ever as soon as you feel its too laborious for you to honor your end of it? Some people actually do value their name being clear and honoring their part of a deal.

Just because you break a contract does not mean you are get away with no penalty. Something will probably happen to you. If you break a contract and have the means to make restitution, you are forced to do so. People who have means will often not break a contract simply because they know that other assets of theirs will be taken in restitution. I am fine with that. I am not fine though with allowing a human being to enter a contract where they basically ""give away"" their right to break said contract. Even if it is voluntary, it is unconscionable in my opinion. 

Realistically, in my mind, you should break any contract that does not benefit you. Now if we are talking about ""feels"", I don't know. It is a value call on your part, I don't think I can make any claims on that.

> Its an unsecured loan. Its not like the entity making the loan can take back the education gained like they could with a car or a house. You may feel that the terms are harsh but the terms are known to both parties going in. Remember that the loan is not for a life saving operation and is very optional.

This is the crux of the argument; you can't take back an education. If you were to make student loans default-able, it would mean that some people would not be able to get loans who currently can (by entering a contract that they cannot break). I can't argue against that.

However, it appears that the result of the reduced price pressure caused by providing these loans to students is rapidly escalating college prices. I would argue that it would be a net benefit to society to do so. Some people who deserve it might not be able to get loans, on the flip side, the cost of college would likely drop dramatically as everyone isn't able to just get loans in order to attend.

This isn't a problem that has a simple solution. 

However, to state it again (and being more general than just talking about student loans). I think allowing a human being to enter a contract wherein they basically give up their right to break said contract is an abomination. It shouldn't be allowed in any just society. You can't hand away your future right to freedom.",1

2813,2813,26p7gi,"Again, the problem isn't that everyone needs to be going to top-tier schools, the problem is that everyone needs to stop pretending they are by paying top-tier prices. The expected lifetime income of your average liberal arts/communications grad from say, Oklahoma State, is probably not much more than a high school graduate (maybe even less given the four additional years of missed earnings). Therefore, the cost of their degree should be close to free from an economic perspective. If college students were rational investors, they would reject such schools until the prices came dramatically down, similar to what investors did with MBS after having their eyes opened in 2008. Of course, college students don't do this because they a) don't comprehend the true lack of value these schools provide, b) don't care because it's not their money, and c) find the value in the other benefits of college (partying, drinking, easy access to sex, etc.). When the bill is being paid by your parents or the government (college students also don't understand loans and think of them as free money) they can rationalize any expense. This needs to stop, or the problem will only continue to get worse. 

Also, congratulations to you on becoming an entrepreneur. But in the same line of thought that not everyone can get into top-tier schools, not everyone can become entrepreneurs.

2935,2935,26p7gi,"Maybe you just aren't familiar with the agency yet? Here's some of its work so far:

1. Mortgage lenders can no longer push you into a high-priced loan: Until recently, lenders were allowed to direct borrowers toward high-interest loans, which are more profitable for lenders, even if they qualified for a lower-cost mortgage—a practice that helped lead to the financial crisis. In early 2013, the CFPB issued a rule that effectively ends this conflict of interest.

2. New homeowners are less likely to be hit by foreclosure: In the lead-up to the financial crisis, lenders also sold Americans ""no doc"" mortgages that didn't require borrowers to provide proof of income, assets, or employment. Last May, the bureau clamped down on this type of irresponsible lending, forcing mortgage lenders to verify borrowers' ability to repay.

3. If you are are delinquent on your mortgage payments, loan servicers have to try harder to help you avoid foreclosure: During the housing crisis, loan servicers—companies that collect payments from borrowers—were permitted to simultaneously offer a delinquent borrower options to avoid foreclosure while moving to complete that foreclosure. New CFPB rules force servicers to make a good faith effort to keep you out of foreclosure. That's not all: Loan servicers will now face civil penalties if they don't provide live customer service, maintain accurate mortgage records, and promptly inform borrowers whose loan modification applications are incomplete.

4. Millions of Americans get a low-cost home loan counselor: In Jan 2013, the CFPB required the vast majority of mortgage lenders to provide applicants with a list of free or low-cost housing counselors who can inform borrowers if they're being ripped off.

5. Borrowers with high-cost mortgages get an outside eye: Lenders who sell mortgages with high interest rates are now required to have an outside appraiser determine the worth of the house for the borrower. If a borrower is going to be paying sky-high prices for a fixer-upper, at least she'll know it beforehand.

6. Fly-by-night financial players will be held accountable: Part of the CFPB's mandate is to oversee debt collectors, payday lenders, and other under-regulated financial institutions that profit off low-income Americans. The bureau is preparing new restrictions on debt collectors, and considering new regs on payday loan industry. In the meantime, the bureau is cracking down on bad actors individually.

7. Folks scammed by credit card companies get refunds: In October 2012, the CFPB ordered three American Express subsidiaries to pay 250,000 customers $85 million for illegal practices including misleading credit card offerings, age discrimination, and excessive late fees. This past September, the CFPB ordered JPMorgan Chase to refund $309 million to more than 2.1 million Americans for charging them for identity theft and fraud monitoring services they didn't ask for.

8. Student lenders face scrutiny: The CFPB oversees private student loan servicing at big banks to ensure compliance with fair lending laws. In December, the agency announced that it will also start supervising non-bank student loan servicers, which are companies that manage borrowers' accounts. Many of these servicers have been accused of levying unfair penalty fees and making it hard for borrowers to negotiate an affordable repayment plan.

9. Service members get extra protection: In June, the CFPB ordered US Bank and its non-bank partner Dealers' Financial Services to refund $6.5 million to service members for failing to disclose fees associated with a military auto loan program. In November, the CFPB ordered the payday lender Cash America to pay up to $14 million for illegally overcharging members of the military.

10. Consumers get a help center: If your bank or lender does anything you think is unfair, the bureau has a division dedicated to fielding consumer complaints. The agency promises to work with companies to try to fix consumers' problems.

2983,2983,26p7gi,"> What if the government subsidized it entirely like you get in some other countries? I imagine the government could force the prices lower if they are the one paying out directly to the colleges.  
  
I think this plays out logically. If government runs higher education completely, college is no longer a market commodity and therefore, yes, in theory they could force prices down (as we see in some European countries).  
  
I feel like with this approach, when you have a monopoly on education, you have the possibility of the quality dropping dramatically (Especially in the U.S, like with K-12). Also, you have more power concentrated in the hands of government which can potentially lead to abuse. The quality drop might not happen in European countries because of cultural emphasis on education (like with K-12 again).  
  
I think the ideal situation would be letting higher education be completely private. Once you have widespread competition, prices will go down. Right now, state-schools take up the entire low-end of the college market, with private schools only able to fill the top niche mostly (where they do a great job).

2985,2985,26p7gi,"They subsidize it directly versus through loans; big difference.

Another difference is the split in the US between state and federal funding. Federal loans have allowed states to spend less, per capita, on higher education than in the past.",14
2986,2986,26p7gi,"Do many European countries have price controls in place though?  They're a dirty word in US politics, but generally when you give someone $5000 in aid for college, tuition is going to go up by $5000.  Sellers are going to charge for their product whatever price people are willing to bear.  IMHO we should be implementing price controls to prevent schools which accept federal aid from doing that.",2
2987,2987,26p7gi,Not everyone goes to higher education in European countries.  Look at the German system - only the very select end up going to Uni.  ,1
2988,2988,26p7gi,Because they choose your career path for you in middle/high school based off one test.  Screw up because you are a late bloomer academically?  No college for you.,1
2989,2989,26p7gi,"Most of the European countries that also subsidize higher education are also not experiencing population growth, many are < 1% [1]. This means they do not need to create more ""legitimate"" colleges. Additionally, large sections of Europe, such as Germany, have very different views on higher eduction and do not spurn vocational schools. These same countries have a much higher criteria for getting into college (not to mention subsidized higher education) [2, I welcome actual German input on this].

Unlike the US where we are growing equally fast (~1%) and still receiving many more individuals through immigration [3]. Combined population growth, immigration, the public school brainwashing that every kid needs to go to college, the virtually limitless education grants/loans programs backed by the US government, and the static number of available student seats in ""legitimate"" colleges, this is a basic recipe for skyrocketing tuition.

If this happened in any other field, no one would be questioning why.

2991,2991,26p7gi,Agreed. I wonder if a MUCH tougher credential to grant degrees would be a good idea. Like if a state college charges more than what is allowed then they looks their status as a degree granting institution and open themselves up to countless lawsuits from current students who were promised a degree.

2992,2992,26p7gi,"Physically no, but a society that is constantly saying college or bust, the pressure to take on those loans is very high, such that if there is even a chance of going to college, you are expected to take those loans. I took the loans, but I also just graduated Summa Cum Laude and will be going on to business school for a low low price because of the work I put in. For me it will probably have been worth it, but I also worked as a tutor and met a lot of people who really had not business being in a college classroom and needed a lot of help and further education before trying at college. I really don't think that if these people had thought they could get a good job without going to college, they would have opted out of taking the loans and going to college. But our culture tells its young people that if you don't go to college, you will never get a good job and you will be forced to live in poverty and work minimum wage for the rest of your life. So yeah, nobody forced them, but nobody told them there were other options either.

Neither.  I was talking about college loans not being consensual.

Let me ask it another way: if a Christian, raised in a Christian home and a Christian community, turns 18 and has the option to start attending a mosque, is there any chance they will choose to do so without some non-Christian influence in their life?

The only recommendation I have is if you ever have time (doesn't look like it :D ), go to the restaurants that you would like to work for at about the time you have free for shifts.

Ask for the manager and don't explain yourself to the other waiters/staff. If they ask what it's about, just say you only want a minute of the manager's time.
Then just ask if he will hire you and what hours you can work. Do NOT ask if they are ""hiring"". Being polite and courteous and dressing accordingly to the place you are going to will give you a much better chance at landing what you want. Have a short resume and/or CV with you and if you get turned down, ask politely that they call if they have any need for a good person to fill a slot. It feels worse being turned down in person, but I guarantee you will have a much hire rate of success this way since it's a industry where appearances and looks along with manners matter a lot. You get that part of the hiring process out of the way when you show up in person.
 
I know it's easy for me to say, but that is all the advice I can give. I've landed all my jobs this way, just politely asking the person to hire me in person. Not calling, no email, no letters.

There are entirely valid reasons for a lender to foreclose on a mortgage hiker, such as non-payment.  The CFPB makes it harder for a business that lives or dies by the color of the ink on its budget to be profitable without raising prices.

The *best* way for me, as a consumer, to learn, is *to get burned*.  To *suffer*.  Recently, I took my car to get fixed at a local mechanic.  I was patient, but the guy literally took *two months* to fix my head gaskets (during which time I was driving a gas guzzling temporary vehicle).  During the two months that it sat, someone decided to break into my car and steal my radio AND the parts I had purchased for the repair, and the mechanic *still* charged me full price for the repair.  I did not adequately document this sequence of events, a mistake that will cost me $1500.

1. No such thing. That is and was ENTIRELY a construct made by a man who couldn't hack it in real economics and blamed the government for it. Coke and Chiquita both proved, beyond any reasonable dissent, that in the absence of government they were perfectly capable of exercising force. Do you know why? Because ANY HUMAN BEING CAN USE FORCE. The government does not have any way to STOP them from doing so. It can merely punish them afterwards. That is not any definition of monopoly.

2. We have seen corporations go into countries with NO government and essentially set up slave labor camps (Coke, Chiquita, etc). What good did their lack of government do them?

3. Government is a tool, a lever that (in our case) was designed to be picked up and used by any citizen with the will to make change happen. The fact that corporations are the ones holding that tool is not the tools fault, it's ours. We laid it down. We did it to ourselves. We can FIX it ourselves.

You are probably talking about MICRO-economics - the economics of a single individual, whereas the cost of education universally (as discuss in the article), is MACRO-economics (that is the behaviors of large groups).  Your suggestion is that lowering the interesting rate is all well and good for any single student (and yes I'm sure it is), but then you don't want to suffer the macro-effects of the (as the article states 1000% rise in college education).  And this is the central truth - that these small interest rate changes make huge differences in demand, and thus translate to costs.

What we do about it, how we fix it, how we get young people building wealth without being debt-burdened for life is a conversation for another day, but, in the end, if anyone's debt savings idea is simply to lower the interest rate, you've effectively increased the total cost.

3218,3218,26p7gi,"Oh! I think I know what you mean. It's the one where a person decides they want a shot at having a decent life making a living by working somewhere for more than minimum wage. Luckily, the Greatest Economy in the World (AKA, the economy of the US) gives the average high school graduate several different paths to achieve this: They can depend on getting lucky by finding a business that doesn't exploit it's human resources as much as possible to get maximum profit (there are surely 1 or maybe 2 companies not contractually obligated to do this), or they can borrow thousands of dollars (maybe hundreds of thousands, if they want to improve their odds) to get a college education and pray to the God-Emperor of Man that their degree isn't completely worthless when they've finished ruining their credit for years/decades to come.

You're right, I don't see what everyone's complaining about! I mean, when the average person graduates high school, they are at peak rationality - when faced with the prospect of an economy that pays almost enough to live on for someone without a college degree, they're obviously going to think about things really deeply. I bet they'll look at student loan interest rates and completely understand all of its implications.

And even though their parents/society told them that college was *the* way to avoid starving to death on the streets, they'll intrinsically understand that they really need to think about their decision. As we all know, 18-year-olds are very good at thinking about the future in a real, concrete fashion. They will make the most rational possible decision.

That's why, when they're stuck working in endless dead-end retail jobs in a desperate attempt to avoid starving while they pay off those student loans, we can be dead certain that their predicament is 100% their fault. They'll be wasting that degree, they'll be wasting all of that money they borrowed for a piece of paper that ultimately ended up being worthless, and they'll be wasting whatever potential they had as human beings in order to work off those loans. And so long as they don't need medical care/vacations/retirement/more than ramen noodles, they might not be dead before those loans are paid off. How about that, see? The economy gives everyone a choice!

But hey, on the plus side, there are only *tens of thousands* (or maybe 100x that or so) of people stuck in that position. All of who owe money on *government-backed* loans. Surely there's no way that could ever harm the Best Economy in the World, right? As everyone with a lick of common sense knows, this will only affect those *many thousands* of individuals who borrow against a future that will never come.

TLDR: Nevermind, you're totally right. The idiots who believed that getting a degree would give them a decent shot at life like everyone told them it would should just shut up and stop whining. It's a bad economy, and that's that. Luckily, the economy is 100% insulated from this problem, so even though the taxpayer money they borrowed will be gone forever as many of these people die before their loans are paid off, we'll still somehow be okay.",5

I take out a mass loan for school because I think that (for some reason) it MIGHT land me a better paying job out of college and I end up getting squat and working the first minimum wage job I can get my hands on I HAVE no way to plan for how long it will take to pay it off.

I happen to think that power delivery and internet need not be monopolies, but water distribution does seem to be a likely candidate for such a monopoly.

Further, I don't accept the idea that a lack of regulation will lead to monopoly.  We do not see monopolies springing up left and right in liberalized economies, we see vibrant competition, companies being born and thriving to companies dying and going out of business.  As I said, the monopolies that have historically been the most harmful to consumers were the ones arbitrarily granted by the government.  The free market monopolies, like Standard Oil and Microsoft, were not generally guilty of the bad acts that we associate with monopolies.  I would say consumers were very much better off *with*  Standard Oil and Microsoft.

What if those constituents make unrealistic demands?  Who are they going to vote for, the politician that says ""No, that's unrealistic."" or the politician who says ""I'll fight for it!""

Markets are good at fairly allocating scarce resources, they only ever suck when external, distorting variables are introduced - and those variables are almost entirely government created ones.

Note: many families can't afford caretakers for their disabled or elderly family members either, for what it's worth.",8
3569,3569,8bgy1k,"No. Doesn't work like that. When I was having issues prior to transplant, had to room with an AWFUL woman who was denied transplant becuase she had no one to care for her. Given her personality, I know why she was alone.",2

3574,3574,8bgy1k,">  many families can't afford caretakers for their disabled or elderly family members either

so they just let them die on the street? i thought america was a first world country?",0
3575,3575,8bgy1k,Either way I'm picking up what you're putting down. It's all good.,2
3576,3576,8bgy1k,"What? That is completely wrong. Other people are indeed what make a person feel desired. If nobody is showing you any attention then you won't feel desired at all. You can't feel desirable if you repeatedly are getting struck out in the dating field. It'll make you feel quite the opposite, totally undesirable. 

Other people indeed effect how a person feels. You spit out the same shit advice I hear from people who've been in relationships for over a decade. They think they know what it's fucking like but you don't. You don't know what it's like to be over 30 and watch everyone you know getting married and start families. You don't know what it's like to repeatedly fail and struggle to meet people. You don't know what it's like to feel like maybe you actually aren't desirable at all. 

I can be as independent as fuck but that still doesn't make me feel like I'm a desirable person. Just once I want to fucking feel loved. I want to know that at least one person likes me. Right now it feels like there isn't a person on earth who does, me included. There isn't much longer I can take this.",1
3577,3577,8bgy1k,Glad we got that sorted out then.  I was trying to make a very jarring point to those who think we are possibly one of those countries where we think education is not a privilege.,1
3578,3578,8bgy1k,Mars?,2

3581,3581,8bgy1k,"Thanks, can you do this for my work too? I'll reddit for you.",2
3582,3582,8bgy1k,"As I said, other people cannot make you feel jack shit.  You're saying that being single is the worst possible outcome, and that tells me that you have work to do internally.  I know it sounds cliche, and I know it sounds like shit advice.  And I don't know if you're assuming whether I'm in a relationship or not.  But if you are miserable *because* of being single, then you better be prepared to be miserable for a variety of reasons, for the rest of your life, until you make an attitude adjustment.  

You cannot expect good people to want a relationship with someone who is already miserable, or who considers being single the ""worst possible outcome.""  No one wants to be in a relationship with a pessimist.  

This isn't even a personal attack on you. I just think you need a bit of a reality check here.  We all want to be desired by people and we all like to romanticize the idea of being in a relationship with another person, but there are certain things that other people simply cannot do for us.",1
3583,3583,8bgy1k,Yeah its in the same neighborhood as the sun.,2
3584,3584,8bgy1k,if you need taken care of and arent given it that's pretty much exactly what would happen.,0
3585,3585,8bgy1k,I’m gonna pass on that generous offer. ,2
3586,3586,8bgy1k,I'm not an introverted person. I'm not the kind of person that enjoys being alone. To me traveling is totally pointless if I'm alone. There's no point in going anywhere if I'm going alone. The entire point is to experience it with other people. Life is just like that. There's no point if it's just me. There's no point in life if I'm going to go do the entire thing by myself. I've never liked being alone. I'm tired of walking the path of life alone. ,1
3587,3587,8bgy1k,The sun?,1
3588,3588,8bgy1k,"Are you in America? Do you know what happens, or just relying on the assholes on reddit?

There's a variety of opportunities--there are group homes, county-fun facilities, hospices, etc. There's even some tax advantages to being a full-time caretaker. There's almost always some sort of medicare/ssi option available that may not be pretty but it does what is necessary. There's a range of various quality to each of these, based on medical need and, yes, insurance options. 

Let's also not forget that compared to Europe, America tends to use more medical procedures to prolong life. That does, in fact, come with an expense that isn't necessarily present otherwise. Whether that's good or bad is debatable, but it's definitely different. 

The options available for Americans aren't terribly outside of the norm than from other western nations. 

Basically, boiling it down to those two options means you don't understand the issue at all.",2
3589,3589,8bgy1k,I can give you a mountain dew with every task completed...,1
3590,3590,8bgy1k,"This has nothing to do with being introverted or extroverted.  The goal is to be happy whether you have a partner or not.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with wanting to do those things with other people, but if you literally don't see the point in going through day to day life without other people, that's a problem.  And in the dating world, it is unfair to place that burden on someone else to be happy.",1
3591,3591,8bgy1k,What kinda tasks are we talking? Because I'm redditing at work right now. Can doing your job top that?,2
3592,3592,8bgy1k,"I know, that's part of what makes me completely undesirable in any way. I'll never be happy alone. It's not an achievable goal. If I could be partially happy in a relationship, then I'd take that. Even a bad relationship. I have a bad life now, I'd much rather have a bad life with a partner than a bad life alone. 

At this point in my life, I've almost accepted that I'll never be happy. And that's not a good realization, because I'm struggling to find reasons to keep going. ",1
3593,3593,8bgy1k,"Ummmm, well I've done it all now. Just processing orders/invoices. Can you start tomorrow? You may need a makeover to look like me though...",2

First I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill in my survey. My German is not that good so I'm sorry if there might be some mistakes in the survey.

Have a nice day and thank you for the valuable insights. :)",1

Nothing about them -- among other controversial food safety, and animal, plant and environmental health issues or technologies -- appears in the SPS chapter. Instead, the chapter describes administrative procedures and consultative arrangements for resolving SPS ""issues"" insofar as they might impede agricultural trade.

Well, no shit. The whole point of the TPP is to create the mutually accepted mechanisms by which to determine whether something is harmful. If it is, it can be banned. If it's not, then it can't be.

I don't get why this article is getting in a huff, the whole chapter is basically making sure that states can't use bogus SPS protectionism - ""you can't import that because it will destroy our ecosystem!!"" or ""hormones are dangerous"", even though there's no scientific backing for it and it's just done to protect domestic industries, whislt allowing them to institute bans and measures *if* there's a reasonable level of scientific evidence that something is harmful.

And no, that's not a nebulous way of defining it. The EU banned US hormone-fed beef imports and lost the US case against it. The EU was given time by the WTO to conduct the studies necessary to prove that hormone fed beef is harmful - the EU couldn't come up with anything, they were just doing it to protect French farmers. The fact is that there's a sweet middle ground between the daily ""5 shocking things you didn't know could kill you!"" listing mundane and banal things like oranges or steak, and literally drinking DMT flavoured orange juice.

It's not like they're specialized in that area, but they seem to write about a lot of areas they're not specialized in when they discuss the TPP. Let me tell you how ISDS really works by shameless reposting an old comment of mine

The hysteria surrounding ISDS on reddit is ridiculous. First, there is no provision in *any* of the 3400+ agreements (which have existed since the 1950s, mind you, and haven't led to any of the apocalyptic shit people like to spout) with ISDS provisions that allow a company to 'sue for lost profits'. They can sue with this in mind, *but they will lose*. The only way an ISDS case can be succesful is if the company demonstrates that the government has breached one of the four fundamental protections of the Investment Protection chapter of the agreement; fair compensation for expropriation, national treatment (discriminating against foreign companies), freedom of movement of capital, or equitable access to the legal system (not allowed to make arbitrary decision for things like applying for permits). 

Let me give you an example of an ISDS case - back in the mid 1990s, the Canadian government decided to ban a fuel additive used by only one company, the American Ethyl Corporation, on the grounds of public health and environmental issues. Ethyl Corp took the Canadian government to ISDS proceedings, and the Canadian government eventually settled - agreeing to pay some twenty million dollars and not enacting the law. In all the papers, it was described as ""company sues Canada over health regulations"". Obviously, this raised a lot of public ire and to this day is still pointed at as why ISDS is bad.

But that's because no one looked at the facts of the matter. Canada was implementing the ban *against the advice of both the Canadian health and environmental departments*. Both said that there was no danger from the additives use in fuel, so why did the government implement it anyway? It turns out, that the party in power had been a long and traditional 'friend' of Canada's own domestic industry. There was no scientific or empirical evidence for the ban, it was purely a way to help out a party donor at the expense of foreigners. 
 
Now, you asked why do governments want ISDS provisions? Well, lets look at TTIP in particular for both sides. European governments are scared of the way that the US has abused it's powers in the past to discriminate against foreign investors, such as the 'buy american' provisions that require that for certain state funded projects, only american goods and services can be used. They're also worried because [the US has historically either implicitly, or explicitly, discriminated against European good and services in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z). For the US, it's because some countries in the European Union don't actually have very strong judiciaries - witness how Victor Orban in Hungary is running roughshod over them, or why Poland has been sued so many times thanks to discriminating against foreign companies. The only way to ensure strong protections for foreign investors is to actually have some form of an enforcement mechanism, and the only viable such mechanism is ISDS. It's basically an enforcement mechanism for treaties to protect investors against regulatory abuses by a government, as well as a way to de-escalate disputes from the state-state level (where much more damage can be done to *both* sides) to the investor-state level.

I mean, every time this topic has come up and the scaremongering comes out, I've challenged people - point me to *one* successful ISDS case that wasn't justified. No one has yet been able to do so. Instead, they point to ongoing cases like the Phillip Morris case against Australia, a case which PM will undoubtedly lose thanks to carve outs in BITs that specify that, *of course*, a government can regulate in the interest of the public for matters such as health, or the environment. Just because a company can sue a government, doesn't mean they will win - and even in domestic courts, people are free to sue for frivolous reasons or those against the public interest - and again, they will also almost certainly lose. ISDS cases don't cost much - OECD figures state that the average ISDS case costs eight million dollars, and even when a company wins they only win on average 2c for every dollar claimed - so when you see a report about ""company suing government for 1 billion dollars"", they'll generally only get 20 million.

Frankly, public perception of ISDS is completely out-of-sync with reality, with a bunch of non-lawyers and non-specialists happy to comment about processes they understand nothing about.

Not a shill and not American, but it's amusing that your only response is to try and legitimize anything I say rather than make your own arguments.",7
4949,4949,3t5ndo,"So! I am in the process of reading the report (the SPS chapter was enough legalese to interpret for one day, so here we are for round 2), but what I've gathered so far is that the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) is way less concerned with what they *do* say in this SPS chapter, and more concerned with aaaaaaaaaall the things they *don't* say in this chapter. The bottom line is that these SPS guidelines leave a little too much wiggle room when it comes to interpreting ""science"", and that the more specific concerns with scientific analysis that *should* be in the SPS chapter have been strategically placed elsewhere in the TPP to create the loopholes we're talking about now.

>For example, the USDA’s grain inspection service would inform the “competent authorities” for grain and oilseed imports that the Grain Inspection and Stockyards and Packers Administration (GIPSA) does not assess the effectiveness of different detection methods for biotechnology-derived traits nor does it determine the characteristics of fortified samples to a particular degree of accuracy, such as what is performed in the preparation of certified reference materials.21
>
>Importing authorities would have to decide whether the GIPSA standards for detecting unauthorized GMOs for import would be adequate to provide the appropriate level of protection for their citizens.

Now here's the kicker:

>But by putting “modern biotechnology” within the chapter on “National Treatment and Market Access for Goods,” the TPP negotiators are able to discuss issues about “trade in products of modern biotechnology” without any reference to the SPS chapter requirements. Instead, any SPS concerns about these products will be discussed in the “Committee on Agriculture Trade (Working Group),” which has **no requirement for experts to discuss or demonstrate risk assessment or risk analysis for GMOs.** What is particularly remarkable about this Trans-Pacific regulatory evasion is that Article 2.29 will apply to products derived from synthetic biology, the next generation of “trade in products of modern biotechnology.” The techniques of synthetic biology are of an order of magnitude more complex than the transgenic plant varieties engineered to withstand multiple applications of a pesticide.

This is the reason for all the hullabaloo about ""money before science"", because the chapter *specifically designed for health and safety concerns* doesn't include anything about some of our *most pertinent health and safety concerns*, especially if we're talking about food that the US is importing. I've got a lot more to go in this report, but it's starting to make sense. I'll keep adding analysis as I'm going so you guys only need to read the whole thing if you want to.

UPDATE: Here's another quote that I found informative:

>The most disingenuous provision within Article 2.29 is this: “Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to adopt or modify its laws, regulations, and policies for the control of products of modern biotechnology within its territory.” (Article 2.29.3) This provision will certainly be invoked ad nauseam to try to make “modern biotechnology” less controversial among the TPP countries’ civil society. However, the passage should come with a footnote, perhaps something such as:
>
>Expect a visit from the U.S. State Department officer for biotechnology and/or the Foreign Agricultural Service representative in your Embassy to discuss how you can adopt our regulations or modify your laws and regulations to better expedite the import of our agricultural products of modern biotechnology. If you refuse the visit, either expect to look for a new job or expect market entry problems for your country’s exports.

UPDATE 2: It looks like another big concern had to do with who is calling the shots, and the fact that scientists aren't the go-to authorities when it comes to, well, science:

>The “appropriate level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection” in the WTO SPS agreement, adopted in the TPP (Article 7.1 et passim) will be determined by the “competent authorities” in U.S. regulatory agencies. However, in the TPP, the “primary representative” (Article 7.1.2) for the implementation of TPP will not be the “competent authorities,” much less the scientists, but in the case of the United States, the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, which has no scientific competence.

i.e. If there is an SPS problem, the TPP gets enforced by a Trade Rep, not a scientist.

UPDATE 3: I FOUND IT!
So my biggest concern (which is why I commented in the first place) had to do with Confidentiality! Yay concealment of important scientific information! I mean...uh...not yay...

>Keeping with the spirit of Confidential Business Information, “All communications between the course of CTC, as well as all documents generated for the CTC, shall be kept confidential unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise” (Article 7.17.6). Thus the “science” to justify an SPS measure, even if it bears directly on public, animal, plant or environmental health, will remain disclosed only to the “relevant trade and regulatory officials.” The disputing Parties cannot proceed to use of the dispute settlement chapter without first having attempt to resolve their differences through CTC meetings (Article 7.17.8). Thus far, it is difficult to see how this dispute settlement procedure is different from that of the application of WTO dispute settlement to SPS disputes.

This sort of ties the previous issues together: if there is a dispute over Health/Safety concerns, the TPP doesn't require that information to go public unless the Parties involved agree that it should. Otherwise the ""relevant trade and regulatory officials"" are the only ones to know about a potential safety risk. This is a huge problem.

The report's conclusion also makes mention of the Transparency requirements, and how smaller exporters have the potential to be overburdened with demands for revisions to policy that would incapacitate them.

4953,4953,3t5ndo,">Maybe I'm misreading the article but that is sure what it sounds like. Companies are allowed to use their own studies to determine if products are safe and those studies never have to be released.

The company doesn't have to release the studies *publicly*, but governmental regulatory agencies *do* have their own researchers that comb through methodology and raw data to make sure the two match, and that the methodology was rigorous enough to support the claim that something isn't harmful/whatever. 

To copy what I wrote to another bloke in this submission;

Believe it or not, the government doesn't have thousands of labs around the country just to replicate the results and each and every experiment that is related to receiving some kind of regulatory approval. It's enough to examine the methodology and raw data. If a company cheated, say good bye company and criminal sanctions on everyone involved - which is why companies don't do that, except in extremely rare occasions, notable for the fact that they're so infrequent.

>Didn't the tobacco industry tell people for years that smoking didn't cause cancer? Do you still believe that?

No one was stopping people researching the cigarette and cancer link, and it's not as if the composition of cigarettes wasn't well known so that it could be tested - the problem was that cigarette companies were obfuscating the research, presenting tests done with specific methodologies to attain the desired results.

**Most importantly**, I'm also not sure where in your comment there's some kind of evidence that companies food safety standards can be ignored in the name of profit. Will companies be able to soak chocolate in arsenic for that metallic tang people so love without fear of consequences? That's what food standards being ignored implies to me.",8

Its not a source its an illustration of how our regulatory agencies fail. Which to be fair to your point of view these agencies require people who run them to understand what their regulating which means they often need to draw from people who worked in the industry

The alternative to liberalized trade via trade agreements is that Americans have to pay more for a smaller selection of goods that are worse quality, pay more in taxes to support inefficient and uncompetitive industry, and be poorer in general over all!

If one accepts the validity for using ISDS, one accepts the validity of future earnings being part of the value of an investment and hence the issue of 'lost profits' is moot.

Let's also not forget that both the Eli Lilly case, and the PMI cases, are still ongoing, and there's a solid chance the companies will lose all three (PMI v Australia is almost a certain loss). It's common in these discussions to treat in progress ISDS cases as successful ones, where if the same standard were applied to domestic cases then we'd be dismantling the court system as we speak.

While on top of that, he was at a local grocery store buying the groceries for front line workers.

5194,5194,i9ukpd,"Mookie! You're exactly what baseball and the world needs in this time of life. So, glad he left that extra-racist town of Boston. Boston, you guys were less than welcoming to Verdugo simply because he had braids/cornrows and started berating him saying that was only for blacks. You guys are hands down known for being racist.

I'm glad that Mookie is in a city that is as diverse as he is a person. You guys don't even deserve Verdugo. For anyone not sure what I'm talking about - Verdugo is the one who said he was berated by Boston Red Sox fans... he ended up shaving his head due to all the racism he was being met with.

Edit: the only people downvoting this are boston red sox fans. He said he was harassed ever since he entered the city being told that his haircut was only for blacks... which is pure ignorance. Cornrows have existed in chicano / hispanic culture for a VERY long time. Your racism is showing if you support what he has experienced.

Edit:
 
Proof of outstanding racism of Boston. This is solid proof. This isn’t even new news. Players have complained about the fans specifically in Boston for their racism. I’ve been nice enough to provide some links, I provide more but I encourage you to do some light research and you’ll see for yourself and I’m not blowing any hot smoke up anyones asses but I’m shedding light on a very real situation.

5197,5197,i9ukpd,My man was handing out rotisserie chickens on methadone mile in the heart of Boston's homeless community. He's as genuine as they come.,90
5198,5198,i9ukpd,I share the same feelings. I'd just like to cling to a petty regional rivalry in August of 2020 but here we are I guess,81
5199,5199,i9ukpd,:(,16
5200,5200,i9ukpd,He’s barely been on the team a few months and I already hate him for liking him,8
5201,5201,i9ukpd,Its ok. He is our Mookie now.,15
5202,5202,i9ukpd,"> I hated him for making me like him

relatable",7
5203,5203,i9ukpd,"Sounds a little similar to how I feel now as a Sox fan in LA, haha. 

Mookie is my favorite player and I love that he does stuff like this and I'm happy he landed with a franchise that actually values him. But I still kinda indefensibly half-hate that he ended up here in the first place. Jealous you guys are going to get to spend the next decade watching him night in and night out, but I'll probably tune in for a good number of them just because I like Mookie (and Kelly, but mostly mookie) so much.",3
5204,5204,i9ukpd,As a yankee fan i totally get you. He was a joy to watch though.,94
5205,5205,i9ukpd,Now you know how we felt about Buster Posey,30
5206,5206,i9ukpd,I disliked Hunter Pence until I heard he fulfilled a Dodger fan’s wish of spreading a family member’s ashes at Dodger Stadium when no one else would,50
5207,5207,i9ukpd,Now you know M's fans feel watching Trout!,16
5208,5208,i9ukpd,Exactly how I feel when Trout demolishes the A's.  Can't even be mad cuz he just seems like a great all-around guy and he's one of the best players of all-time.  Sometimes you just have to put your rivalry hatred aside and admire history in the present.,3
5209,5209,i9ukpd,Imagine how I feel. I couldn't get away from articles and videos saying Mookie just tied the record for 3 homers in a game.,1
5210,5210,i9ukpd,"Exactly what I came in to say, and I really shouldn’t be surprised it’s the top comment.",117
5211,5211,i9ukpd,YES FUCK THAT GUY,42
5212,5212,i9ukpd,It’s fuck John Henry til the day i die,39

5214,5214,i9ukpd,"Fuck John Henry, but also fuck Sam Kennedy. The man had the audacity to come out and say that he was disappointed when Mookie signed his extension. Hmmm, maybe you shouldn’t have fucking traded him in the first place if you didn’t want him to sign with another team.",32

5230,5230,i9ukpd,"Top 2 player in the game imo

Said it when he was here, I'll say it until he proves us otherwise. If Trout didn't exist, we would have all the similar hypothetical threads about Mookie. Sitting at 2 MVPs and 43 WAR at 27? He's that good",32
5231,5231,i9ukpd,Cue some LA fan telling us to ‘take care of Dugie’. They can fuck off preemptively with that shit.,-1

Verdugo recorded an underage girl getting assaulted in a hotel room.",4

I would like to read that article.

You're being downvoted because you're a liar.",1

Crap.",103
5244,5244,i9ukpd,"As a boycotting Sox fan, if I lived in LA I'd honestly probably just adopt the Dodgers. They're a fun team anyway, except that half-season they had Machado, and with Mookie, Price, and Kelly they're Boston West (before that it was Beckett, Gonzalez, Crawford, and Punto, and before that it was Mannywood, so it's a recurring theme at this point).",6

5249,5249,i9ukpd,Didn’t know. Source? That’s very bro of him.,20
5250,5250,i9ukpd,I disliked hunter pence until he chose to sign with the giants instead of the Astros this off season,6

5253,5253,i9ukpd,"Yup. Fuck everyone in that ownership/management group. I'm not gonna hate on Bloom for doing the job he was hired for, like I don't hate DD for doing the same. But all the real decisionmakers didn't want to pay Mookie, and did everything in their power to try and make it not look like their fault he's gone.",6

5259,5259,i9ukpd,"Keeping Mookie would have made the Sox significantly *more* likely to keep winning if Henry didn't want to use the luxury tax as an excuse.

What happened to that person was absolutely awful but if you are trying to say that’s how LA fans are, you’re incredibly wrong. That’s one thing. There is a multitude of accounts of Boston being racist. Does that mean you’re all racist?",19
5283,5283,i9ukpd,"Yep. ALL of Boston is racist. And I guess ALL of LA is a bunch of thugs who beat the shit out of people in the parking lot after the game.

Verdugo is a piece of crap. Just like LA",3

5295,5295,i9ukpd,Yeah just like how “all” of LA starts fights. I never said all of Boston is racist. All I said is that Boston is known for being heavily racist and it’s seems like it’s quite known across the board of MKB players. Maybe you didn’t read into the sarcasm of my other comment - no one can speak on the behalf of every single person from anywhere.,0
5296,5296,i9ukpd,Did you even read the fucking article? Your answer clearly shows that you didn’t.,1
5297,5297,i9ukpd,He shaved his head when he was first out there. Jesus dude. He doesn’t have corn rows anymore does he?,0

5299,5299,i9ukpd,"Lately I’ve been feeling these weird feelings too man. I’ve only been allowed to say the word “fuck” at ball games when I was surviving the brutal winter of summer games in sf as a kid. 

I will always root against the dodgers against intra conference games but I can’t help but respect the dodgers for being good sports.  And joe Kelly’s podcast appearance was great. 

The sanctity of baseball before my hatred of the dodger blue.  But since your first series with the Asterisks I’ve been glad to have such solid rivals.",23

5304,5304,i9ukpd,"I did, it made it pretty clear he had some ability to take action, refused, and while he doesn't want to bring it up, I think it is more than fair to bring up. 

It even brings up the fact that some think he had more involvement (as I mentioned unlikely due to the change in story) even if he did... 

I think you are just the idiot here",0

5310,5310,i9ukpd,"Yeah - you didn’t read. Thanks for lying. Who cares what you think about me, the fact is you didn’t read and that is more indicative of being a complete idiot.

You can’t keep your eye on everyone at a party with 10 people. You don’t even know anything about the situation. What happens if this was in the restroom? 

Stop speaking out of your ass for once.",1
5311,5311,i9ukpd,"Dude be fucking patient. I already said I’m looking. The main point I was even making is that Boston is racist and you’re latching onto the head shaving, lmao.",-1
5312,5312,i9ukpd,That’s fine I just posted 3 other articles from other players from different teams literally saying how racist Boston is. I’ll keep looking for Verdugos account even though that doesn’t diminish what other players have experienced. Go to my original comment for the articles.,0
5313,5313,i9ukpd,This is gross just fuck already you two,7
5314,5314,i9ukpd,So fuck Mookie too right? He was on a cheating team winning a World Series series as well.,-14
5315,5315,i9ukpd,Exactly. Baseball players across the board have all complained specifically about Boston being noticeably racist,2
5316,5316,i9ukpd,"Lying about what? Do I need to pull the fucking quotes from the article about it? 

You can't all the time, but if you are at a party with about 10 people (and that 10 is generous because it sounds more like 7-8 from the stories) and two people disappear, questions are generally asked. That is what being a friend and looking out for people entails. Hell last time me and my friends had a semi-large party, two people decided to walk a mile to go to McDonalds at like midnight because they were hungry, not much was open, and everyone was drunk. I might have been pretty well drunk, but I was still keeping tabs on them every 5-10 minutes because I didn't want them to have any issues (two drunk college aged kids walking along a main road, surely nothing could ever go wrong) as I was the host and felt responsible. I don't think I'm anything special on that, I would be willing to bet most people are in that area. 

You could say, ""well you aren't going to interrupt anything"" which I say, Verdugo knew how drunk the girl was based on what happened before with her and the other girls. He knew she was in no shape to be doing anything with anyone. Did he want to get involved with stopping something his buddy was doing? Probably not, and look what happened, he was partially responsible for not stopping a preventable sexual assault best case scenario.

Edit: What if it was the restroom? First off it wasn't, the girl's story said a bed at a hotel, second off, if we are talking people getting drunk and going into the restrooom, if they aren't responding I'm going in to check on them. Do you know how dangerous that could be if someone passes out in there without anyone to make sure they don't either hurt themselves accidentally or pass out in a bad position?",0
5317,5317,i9ukpd,"Lol this is so stupid, I'm well aware of of some of the shit boston fans have said and done, im not arguing that. fuck man, im gonna go enjoy the dodger game and you should too.",-2

But that isn’t good enough for you. You’re a whack ass.",1
5320,5320,i9ukpd,"I am enjoying the dodger game right now. Finding where Verdugo specifically even brought it up is tough because it was on Twitter and it’s tougher to cypher between tweets to find info. My main point was that Boston is known for being racist, I even posted other players experiences that I could find on my initial comment. Have a good rest of your night. Go Dodgers.",0
5321,5321,i9ukpd,Lol at dodger fan supporting a cheater when he is on your team but not when a cheater is against you.,-1
5322,5322,i9ukpd,"I'm saying that I haven't ever been at a small party were there was a sexual assault, I would be willing to wager the same for the majority of the population. 

The fact it was a hotel room and a small party, and allegedly happened on a bed, all points to the fact it wasn't a well hidden event. Verdugo might have been let off because they didn't have evidence to tie him to it, or they didn't think it anything would stick because he didn't do too much wrong in the eyes of the law, there was the changing story about him, and they clearly had another target, but it doesn't mean that the public is so quick to clear him...",0

Nandi.. Namaskaaram ..🙏",1
5791,5791,15vxs9l,"1. Boil pasta(I like spaghetti) with lots of salt for around 8-10 minutes. After that keep a cup of pasta water separate.
2. While it is boiling - cut garlic into tiny prices, chop fresh parsley or coriander leaves, Crush dried chilli into flakes(use a grinder). 
3. In a pan heat (virgin) olive oil in a low to medium flame. 
4. When the oil is hot add the garlic. Cook it until it starts to turn golden brown. Then add chilli flakes. 
5. Add a sauce - I’m currently using store bought one(barilla basilico)
6. Add small amount of pasta water to the sauce and wait it starts to thicken. 
7. Add the pasta, small amount of pasta water and mix it well. 
8. When it starts to dry garnish it with parsley/coriander leaves and oregano. 

You can add chicken or any cooked meat to the sauce while cooking. 

You can also add oregano to the sauce, but I like to add it in the end.",2

5803,5803,rtje17,"Zapatista Uprising (1994)

Image Transcription: Masked members of the EZLN giving an address, with a Mexican flag in the background. 

On this day in 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) declared war on the Mexican Government, demanding ""work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace."" This action was taken at least partly in response to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), perceived as a threat to the lives of indigenous people in Chiapas.

Following this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records. The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.

I agree with elements of it (if you can read the essay “your politics are boring as fuck” which I thought was decent) but I often find them doing a lot of unnecessary infighting with firm socialist Anarchists like myself.

5835,5835,rtfelu,I could take a stab at it... because Zapatistas first try to reject Eurocentric models of politics.  Rejecting labels like anarchist is second nature to them and it sounds like Post-Leftism still relies on those Eurocentric labels that it'll get the flak with it too.,8

6271,6271,15r9i17,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

I figured I’d ask here since this sub tends to be pretty science minded. But I have extended family that loves watching these documentaries and then raving about it to the rest of us. Personally I find them bullshit. And these same family members don’t really think critically or do their research outside of it or listen to real medical experts. One of them brought one up again and it was kind of triggering because I deal with a lot of food anxiety these days and tend to not eat more than a handful of certain meals. 

Anyways things that I’ve heard in the past that they got from food documentaries and holistic medicine:

- sugar is awful for you, avoid at all costs, it’s more addictive than heroin
- all carbs are bad for you
- organic is healthy and every other produce is pumped full of toxic pesticides and unhealthy
- GMOs are the worst thing ever. GMOs are full of pesticides and bad for you
- fasting, especially intermittent, is very good for you
- meal replacement shakes (typically from MLMs) are good
- a lot of crash diets that cut out certain foods, even though I’ve never seen make make a noticeable difference in their weight

1. What do you think of food documentaries?
2. Have you had experience with people in your life being like this? Is there a kind way to either get them to shut up about it or try to redirect them to more proper scientific sources?
3. Do you have recommendations for any online science accounts or sites that talk about this and help debunk these food myths? The main one I know is Unbiased Science. But they started out as a vaccine/Covid information hub and only occasionally debunk harmful food myths

I remember decades ago, before the dark times, seeing good documentaries on the discovery channel.  Even a few food and health ones iirc.

Seems like it started becoming a big issue in the early 90's and some of it has always sounded a little crazy to me.  Nowadays, I don't know who or what to believe, because along with all the false information put out, you also have people who overcorrect and make too much of things.  These people might hear one thing bad about the most healthy food available and claim that it's unhealthy.",2
6278,6278,15r9i17,"> What are your opinions on food/health documentaries?

Nutrition is something that I'm kind of interested in so I'd bel lying if I didn't say I was sort of into them.  Before going any further it should be stated that nutritional science is very hard to do for a number of reasons so we really know very little about anything for sure and everything you read in the space should be looked at more as a best guess than a well grounded fact.  Also, anyone can make a documentary so I feel like giving an opinion on them in general is sort of pointless as there can be a massive difference in quality between any two particular films.  Some are pretty good, some are straight trash.  Hard to really judge individually, but if you read/watch enough you can sort of see trends associated with higher quality stuff.  These trends are pretty well summed up by Michael Pollin's mantra: Eat food, Not to much, Mostly plants.

To the specific claims:

Sugar: This is a bit of an exaggeration but like sugar is bad for you and you should try to limit your intake.

Carbs: Complex carbs are fine, you should try limit simple carbs but they're also fine in moderation.

Organic: There might be a benefit as far as the environment goes.  There aren't any known health benfits, or at least they're too small to be worth the additional costs.

GMO's: I think people are a bit to cavalier on the idea that no GMO ever will have any negative health effects, but we haven't found any yet.  That's something regulators should be worried about though, not you as an individual consumer.

Fasting: So there has been research suggesting this is the case for some organisms but the effects seem to diminish the longer a creatures natural lifespan is and there hasn't been the kind of research necessary to say one way or the other if it matters for humans.  It might be a worthwhile gamble depending on how much you value living longer/eating regularly but we don't really know anything for sure right now.

Meal replacement shakes: Probably not.  I mean maybe they're fine, but it sure seems like one of the few things we do know about nutrition is more processed = less healthy and it's hard to imagine these aren't highly processed.

Crash Diets: Yeah these are all just straight up snake oil.  There's no magic bullet for loosing weight, you just need to eat less than you currently are and exercise.

To follow up questions:

> What do you think of food documentaries:

Again I enjoy them but I go into them knowing there's a lot of BS in the space.

> Have you had an experience:

Again this is something I'm interested in so it's not a problem for me.  I do just bring up the higher quality sources when it's happening but it's not an annoyance to me.

> Do you have recommendations:

Not that aren't obvious.",2
6279,6279,15r9i17,"The more I watch documentaries about things I am formally educated in and actively do for a living, which are always full of so much garbage, the less I trust documentaries about things I am not as well-informed about. It is far too easy to charm and mislead someone in documentary format, or to promote half-truths that would be corroborated by a very brief google search but debunked by an education. 

So I dislike nutrition documentaries but not noticeably more or less than any other genre.",2

1:  I think that most food documentaries are bogus.  Weight is a big insecurity for most people, so it it is easy to sell them quick fixes that dont really work.  The truth is that there isnt much money to be made in telling people that yes, your problems are complicated and cant be solved with a silver bullet  

2: I have know a lot of people who did fad diets like Keto, Paleo, fasting, 1200 cal, etc.  Some even get into more dangerous fads like raw milk.  Unsurprisingly almost none of them succeed at losing weight.  I always tell people that if you diet requires every moment of every day to be a test of willpower, then it will fail

Carbs are essential but cheap to mass produce and mostly have added sugar. Whole grain bread, rice, potatoes are solid choices but again don’t over eat them. 

Intermittent fasting has shown some health benefits, especially how your body processes blood sugar. 

Pesticides and GMOs aren’t ideal for consumption, natural and organic is better. But pesticides and gmos are what allows us to produce enough affordable food for everyone.

It was also educational because I definitely grew up being brainwashed that it was normal for raw meat to have salmonella in it and it was YOUR responsibility as the consumer to cook the meat up to temp so as to avoid the risk of catching it.

Now I realize that raw meat ISN’T supposed to have risks of contracting food borne illnesses and a lot of the times these bacterial outbreaks come from things you don’t cook like lettuce or peanuts as the documentary mentions.

പതിവ് പോലെ റെഡ്ഡിറ്റിൽ ഇല്ലാത്ത തള്ളു കഥകൾ പറഞ്ഞും ആവശ്യമില്ലാത്ത കാര്യങ്ങൽക്ക് അഭിപ്രായം പറഞ്ഞും  സിനിമാ പാട്ടുകളിൽ ലയിച്ചും സമയം തള്ളിനീക്കി.

ഇതിനിടയിൽ അടുക്കള ഭാഗത്ത് ഇതിനു മുന്നേ കാണാത്ത ഒരു വസ്തു ഇരിക്കുന്നതായി ശ്രദ്ധയിൽ പെട്ടു, പാസ്ത. ഇന്നത്തെ പരീക്ഷണം ഇതിൽ തന്നെ എന്ന് ഉറപ്പിച്ചു. എളുപ്പത്തിൽ  വീട്ടിൽ ഉള്ള സാധനങ്ങൾ കൊണ്ടു ഉണ്ടാക്കാൻ പറ്റുന്ന ഒരു റസിപിയും കണ്ടെത്തി.

ഉണ്ടാക്കി വന്നപ്പോൾ എനിക്കുതന്നെ തോന്നിപ്പോയി ഇത് ഉള്ളികറി ആണോ ഉണ്ടക്കുന്നെ എന്ന്. അധികം വൈകിയില്ല, സ്ഥിരം ബലിമൃഗം ആയ സഹോദരനും ഞാനും രുചിച്ചു നോക്കി. വൻ പരാജയം. ടൊമാറ്റോ സോസ് പാകത്തിന് ഇല്ലാ. അങ്ങനെ പലതും ഇല്ല. വിദേശത്ത് ആയിരുന്നപ്പോൾ ആദ്യമായി പുട്ട് ഉണ്ടാക്കിയത് ഓർമ വന്നു ഇത് കഴിച്ചപ്പോൾ. വേവാത്ത ഗോതമ്പ് പുട്ട് അന്ന് പഴവുമായി കുഴച്ച് കഴിക്കുക ആയിരുന്നു അവസാനം. 

ടേസ്റ്റ് നോക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി കഴിച്ച അച്ഛൻ്റെയും അമ്മയുടെയും മുഖത്ത് ഞാൻ രുചിച്ചിട്ട് പ്രകടം ആക്കുന്ന പുച്ഛം കണ്ടൂ. ബാക്കി വന്നത് പ്രിയ സുഹൃത്തിന് നൽകിയാലോ എന്ന് ചിന്തിച്ചു. പിന്നെ മിണ്ടാപ്രാണിയോട്  ക്രൂരത വേണ്ടാ എന്ന് വെച്ചു.  ഇന്നലെ കണ്ട സ്വപ്നത്തില് പോലും പാസ്ത എന്നെ തുരത്തി ഓടിക്കുന്നതാണ് കണ്ടത്.

6348,6348,12nq6ru,"I picked up cycling in Sept 2021 as I was alone at home due to COVID. Would do long runs of 60-70km during weekends. At that time I wasn't aware of sugar content in cool drinks and I drank 2-3 bottles of Maa during long runs and 1 bottle on short runs. Then I got addicted. I thought the cycling will balance out the ill effects of drinking cool drinks. By April 2022 I got out of shape with saggy stomach and hanging man breast. I wanted to go to gym but I couldn't find a gym partner. I was afraid of going alone as I thought they will make fun of me as  during childhood I was never an athletic person and classmates will avoid me in sports as I have glasses.

I met an old classmate during a wedding function and gave him a kaikuli food treat at a nearby mall. I said this is my chelav for getting my job. My main intention was to persuade him to come to gym with me. I told this in a very casual way and he accepted. Weight 72kg. Body fat 23%.

I started going to gym with him on May 5 2022.  The old classmate came for 1 week and he left for some job. I became alone. Luckily there was a good trainer who will make us workout/ correct forms without being asked. The first 2 weeks trainer made me do body weight exercises, and the last 2 weeks, weight training, 1 body part a day. The trainer left month end as his wife delivered a baby. As I was very ugly at the moment I was afraid to ask someone for advice/ correct my form.I became alone again(2).

I was searching for workouts  in yt as I forgot what trainer had told me. Thats how I found Mr. India suresh kumar's yt channel which had very good not exaggerated workout playlist. I would watch the workout video of that body part every day and do it. I created a table in notion to track my waist, chest, weight etc.

Months passed. I could see the results both in tables and photographs. My belly started reducing and weight started to dip. I do wfh, So in  free time I used to watch lot of fitness channels like Jeff Nippard, Athlean X, Jeremy Either. That increased my knowledge and I started correcting forms of my gym peers. That way I made a lot of friends.

Last week when I was bathing I noticed my abs are barely visible. I didn't take any diet as of now, but I eat rice only once a day , cut all the sugar and no oily snacks. I weigh 67kg with 18 percent body fat now. I'm proud of where I'm today.

Now coming to answers from my experience

I would suggest doing ground/ stretching exercises for a week. Try to attain a minimum level of doing 7-8 pushups before you join so you don't have to feel embarrassed. Get a gym partner. Do 1 body part a day until you get comfortable with the form. Start with small weights and do progressive overloading. Once you get everything right switch to push, pull legs routine. Never skip strength building workouts like bench press, dead-lift and squat.

I didn't have any prior exp in weight lifting. I started with just the bar and not the weights. You don't have to be ashamed, everyone starts like this.Now I bench 40 kgs. Always keep someone near while doing bench press and squat.

Motivation before: loneliness, looked ugly. To be frank loneliness was the sole reason for my consistency. Motivation now: news targets everyday, new skills to explore like handstands. Women started noticing me in cafes, malls etc.

[On this day](https://www.apeoplescalendar.org/calendar/day/1-1) in 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) declared war on the Mexican Government, demanding ""work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace."" This action was taken at least partly in response to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), perceived as a threat to the lives of indigenous people in Chiapas.

Following this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records. The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.

6359,6359,rtd1m3,"I only get my coffee from the zapatistas. Starbucks and many of the anonymous mega-conglomerate coffee wholesalers that operate in the USA have been linked to the Ocosingo Regional Coffee Growers Association, a terrorist group that murders indigenous children in the middle of the night to try and drive them off the land. The liberal democratic government of Mexico still grants ranch permits to white Hispanic landowners who have ""claims"" to own land of the Mayan Zapatista communities that have lived there since time immemorial. They fund fanatic fascist militias like the ORSGA, they and others like them think they are cowboys fighting Indians like the wild westerns, they have dehumanized indigenous leftists to the point fired high caliber weaponry in the general direction of the communities on Christmas.

I am Native American myself. borders are fake, I will always be in solidarity with the Zapatistas

Marcos is gay in san francisco, black in south africa, an asian in europe, a chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the metro at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains.

Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, oppressed minorities resisting and saying `enough'. he is every minority who is now beginning to speak and every majority that must shut up and listen. he is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable -- this is marcos.

Hello foodies, I love food  and love to explore new cuisines. But whenever someone asks me my fav food I don't have an proper answer.

But I'm struggling to bring a balance with Kerala food and other alternatives since while living with family, it's a bit difficult to avoid rice altogether. 

Also, figured out after some years that salads should include some protein to make it tasty, be it chicken or eggs or paneer. Eating only veggie salad which tastes so bland just demotivates us to go that healthy route too.",5

6800,6800,1c2zsk,Investors want economic growth because that's the only way to make money without working for it. ,3
6801,6801,1c2zsk,"The problem is this: No infinite growth, strong middle class, capitalism. You can only pick two.

Capitalists - specifically, the class of people who own capital and do not engage in a form of labor - demand return on investment in exchange for the use of their capital. That is the capitalist business model. Seriously: Go to any bank and ask for a zero percent interest loan. They'll laugh you out of town. The only opportunity for a strong middle class to exist is if they can provide a return on investment, typically through an employment relationship; and the only way for that to happen is if you have infinite growth. If you limit growth, or more specifically, admit that growth cannot continue forever, then returns on investment become harder and harder to obtain as you hit the scaling limit. This means that you can't really have a strong, wide ""middle class"". Everyone will be pushed to the lower fringes of social organization as the music stops in our little game of musical chairs and we find that all the chairs were being rented from some huge conglomerate private finance organization.

Okay, so let's say you really want both sustainable economics and a strong middle class. You have to get rid of the other bit of the triangle then, which is the economic organization of ownership into a class of owners distinct from labor and the resulting demand for return on investment (e.g. growth). I.e., you have to get rid of capitalism. *Good Luck With That.*

The two big problems are political and economic. The politics are the first barrier, and it will stop you dead in your tracks, possibly by a CIA or FBI agent shooting you dead in your bedroom. (This happened) Let's just say that your act of social engineering will NOT go well with the owner-classes, who will call for your head. When *their* wealth is questioned, the shit hits the fan sociopolitically. Look at the entire history of US warfare over the entire industrial age to today. You will find *plenty* of what you would call in modern terms ""wars for oil"".

Furthermore, the propaganda of the rich and powerful is everywhere. Your first opponent will be the owners but they will not attack you directly. They will get the population at large to mock and discredit you until you are a political non-factor. This is what happened to Occupy Wall Street, which wasn't even calling for an end to capitalism (at least not publically, many of the people at OWS were socialist anarchists, but many more were modern/left-wing liberal capitalists.) - the capitalists have enormous (but not complete) social control and many, many years of entrenched roots (which, in some cases, can go all the way back to explicit feudal nobility).

Even then, everything I've described sounds like a barrier that could, at least hypothetically, be overcome. Let's say you do. *Now what?* There are plenty of existing social models for non-capitalist economies, some of which were actually brought into play as actual sovereign nations with legal systems designed to control, prevent, or destroy capitalism. The problem is, most of them were countries you would never want to actually live in. They were brutal dictatorships, that replaced the tyrrany of the capitalist with the tyrrany of the state. State-mandated socialism isn't an option, if you wanted to maintain a strong middle class. What's next?

An interesting aside here is that capitalism is an accident. If you accept the idea that social and political structures are a function of technology level over time, then you also should note that large-scale capitalism is very much enabled by industrial technology. Before capitalism, we had feudalism, which involved fixed social roles under a monarch. This was the optimal economic structure at the time, when the economy was largely agricultural, and technology was limited. But this economic structure also doesn't have a concept of ""return on investment"". It's very much a steady-state, no-growth economy. But limiting the world's technological progress (or having it limited for us by societal collapse) probably isn't what you wanted either.

So let's go back to other non-capitalist economies. We know that the previous experiments with state-mandated socialism were complete failures. What if we got rid of the state? There are plenty of sociopolitical theories, bundled under the vague misnomer of ""Anarchism"" (they don't involve what is commonly called ""anarchy"", i.e. disorder and chaos). The core idea behind them is that we have socialism and democracy, but we don't have it enforced by the state. In fact, there's no state at all! Anarchists reject all hierarchies, that is, any system where one person is considered superior or in control of another person. Power corrupts, so nobody should hold any sort of power.

Another aside: I haven't defined ""socialism"" yet, but for the purposes of this discussion, I'll say this: Socialism is an economic system where the people who labor are also the owners of the means of production by which their labor is used. I.e. there are no owners. You can have socialist organization inside of a capitalist economy, e.g. by tying employment to stock ownership. But most socialists want to move to a system in which ALL labor is free of ownership. It's not just about creating new socialist production, it's about getting rid of capitalist ownership too.

So if nobody has power over other people in an Anarchist society, how do you organize large-scale production? The typical answer is direct democracy, i.e. that you have people voting on things and proposing things. If this sounds kooky to you, then you're getting to the core of my argument, which is that you're picking at hard problems. The problem with Anarchism is that it's a social system, not a political one. Like all social systems it relies on widespread acceptance of it's core tenets in order to function. You can't force someone to be an Anarchist.

I do believe that, at some level, social hierarchy and greed are, if not baked into the human brain, very damn close to - e.g. so core to the societal environment that permeates the first world that it's very hard to eradicate such ideas. This doesn't mean that humans have to be greedy or controlling bastards. It means that you have to recognize and act against this fact; you have to be conscious of the fact that you're engaging in such behavior and stop it. Hell, we have primates that engage in similar social hierarchies that we would want or need to eliminate to get to Anarchism, so that would at least indicate that there's very deep seated behavior we need to change - again, by conscious action, agitation, and education.

The only problem is that such things are very slow. And it's not even because of the capitalists this time, I'm honest. Look at how long it's taken feminism to actually achieve it's current gains, and how long it will take to achieve something even resembling equality. Or, replace ""feminism"" with ""civil rights movements for persons of color"", or what have you. There are extremely deep seated social structures (or even deep-seated urges) which prevent or block social progress. You have to respond with education, patience, and anger in equal amounts. Social engineering like the many state-mandated socialist dictatorships only ended in pain, while social systems like Anarchism require a wide base of support to function, and that won't be around for some time.

The only problem is: will the environment wait for us to catch up?",8

The infinite growth paradigm/fallacy is the belief that there is an inexhaustible amount of resources available to be readily exploited on this planet.  Science says otherwise.  There is a point in every eco-system in which a species' population simply can nolonger increase, and every species that undergoes a massive population explosion ALWAYS undergoes an equally massive population decline, often very rapidly.  Economists ignore this fact, and cleverly avoid it by calling these type of limitations ""externalities"", because they don't fit into the infinite growth fallacy.  There comes a point, on a finite planet, with finite resources, that it becomes impossible to maintain the level of consumption required to support a species that exploits the resources in it's ecosystem.  The natural world (and the physical laws of the universe) always corrects this imbalance.  The price or cost of things is directly related to the scarcity of those resources, but there comes a time when scarcity becomes such a dominate factor, that the use of the resource becomes a moot point.  The level of consumption cannot be sustained, the competition for those resources becomes to great and die-offs occur.  The human population has exploded since the industrial revolution, but that rate population expansion cannot be sustained.  So, as a species, we can either drastically reduce our level of consumption and then maintain that level at sustainable amounts, with a sustainable population (and thereby leveling the value/cost of those goods) and achieving a balance, or we can follow the infinite growth paradigm to an inevitable and rapid population correction (and likely extinction).  

Aside from colonizing space and exploiting extraterrestrial resources, which may or may not be possible in time to avoid the population (and I'm going with the ""not possible in time scenario""), those are the only two choices we have - Achieve sustainability by consuming less and through deliberate population control or by doing what we've been doing since the industrial revolution and waiting for the inevitable collapse and perhaps hoping in the meantime that we can somehow learn to transcend earth.",7

Now, it's easy to say that's simply ""politics of envy"" as Romney would put it, but inequality and immobility lead to huge long term problems especially when it's growing like it is in the US. 

For example, more poor people means more people who are less likely to receive a good education, which means fewer doctors, scientists, engineers, and other professionals necessary to build, create, and innovate. The big reason why you always hear about other countries passing the US up in these areas is that other countries are reducing inequality through their development and growth, thus producing more of these professionals. Meanwhile America's inequality is growing, producing far fewer individuals. Therefore, America's vital industry suffers.

More simply, earning more in wages leads to a lower total income level).  A negative income tax, on the other hand, allows for a smooth transition off of welfare. 

I understand where you're coming from w regards to a static (or increased!) level of bureaucracy under this plan, but I think you're wrong. We already have a mechanism in place to send cash to taxpayers in the tax return, which means that the increase in complexity at the IRS would likely be small. It simply amounts to a rule change. Meanwhile, you're cutting some of the most complex, bureaucratic organizations in the government, ie Medicare, Social Security, et c. Overall, I think it would lead to a much more manageable and less intrusive government, while allowing people more freedom of choice. 

The main problem would be the transition period, where people would have to find new health insurance et c. and the laid-off government workers would need to find new jobs. That would be hard. But I think that, ultimately, it would result in a more equitable arrangement for everyone involved.

As GMOs are new, we do not know the long term health effects. As of right now, there has been no adverse allergies or other problems, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. 

In fact, it wouldn't be too hard to add genes for say a tomato to create the allergens found in peanuts. If this was done on accident because it was thought that the allergens would help tomato growth, it could have consequences for those who don't realise the tomato has been modified.

Yes, there is a lot of scaremongering, and I think GMOs are the way forward, but constant testing and research on these plants is vital to our and ecosystems health. It's important not to dismiss this by saying concretely that GMOs are safe to eat.",7
7123,7123,dbashf,"I am a proponent of GMO crops, and work in a related industry.

One of the largest issues facing the developers of these genetics is keeping it out of the food chain until the changes can be tested. For certain crops, wind can carry modified pollen. Wildlife is nearly impossible to keep out of field crops. Many crops will spontaneously  reseed themselves.

With this, unintended consequences are huge. Even assuming that the effects of a single gene are known, genes do not always act independently. Our level of knowledge, while growing rapidly, may never develop to a point where all of the effects from the insertion of a single gene can be easily traced.

Well, genetics is not so simple. A gene itself does not neatly correspond to a single characteristic. We were taught in high school about dominant vs recessive, hereditary traits, punnet squares, and so on... which is a massive oversimplification of how genes work. A gene might be better thought of as a letter, which doesn't have an intrinsic meaning. If we were to alter the E gene in that last sentence, ""A gogo might bo bottor thought of as a lottor""

It sort of works, but genetics is not as simple as activating the grow big gene. The truth is, we can't guarantee that it's a good idea.

7125,7125,dbashf,"I can offer a counterpoint that nobody talks about, yet is a very serious issue which must be addressed, particularly in the face of rapidly changing climate & ecosystems.

You mention that creating a pest-resistant crop is not harmful to humans. Perhaps not directly, but what about the effect on the pest which evolved alongside that plant species? Let’s say it’s a weevil which eats the roots of corn plants.

So we genetically engineered our corn to resist these weevils. The weevils can’t eat it. What will they eat instead? Consider the hypothetical scenarios:

1) The weevils will move to a different plant species, let’s say soy. All soy crop is completely decimated by the weevils. Additionally, in some corn fields, the lack of weevils has caused a crop crash as the weevils had been providing more aerated soil for the roots, and now the soil is too dense. Now you need to modify the corn again to thrive without the weevils, and modify the soy to resist them.

2) The weevils will eat nothing. Weevil populations are down 95%. The corn is thriving. We have done good. Five years later, ecologists are scratching their head over the sudden disappearance of what used to be a common bird. As it turns out, the weevils used to defend their territory against other invertebrates. When they died, a certain spider was able to establish large numbers among the corn field. These spiders were very skilled at killing  a certain moth, and that moth was one of the only food sources for the missing birds. The birds are now extinct.

3) The weevils will adapt to eat the corn. Now, with their more robust jaws and poison resistance, they become much more effective corn killers. All corn that is missing the genetic modification is utterly destroyed by the weevils, and the modified corn only slows them down. Their stronger jaws allow them to also eat plants which would have been impossible before— walnut and oak trees begin coming down with terrible weevil infestations.

The bottom line is— modifying the ecosystem will change the ecosystem.

Just because something seems beneficial does not mean it comes without devastating consequences.

Now the scenarios above might reek of doomsday conspiracy, but [you would be surprised](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100513/full/news.2010.242.html) at the unpredictable effects of seemingly minor genetic modifications, or even of [pest control done with the best intentions](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-four-pests-campaign-objectives-execution-failure-and-consequences.html)

>Humans have modified plants and animals for millennia, a banana is no less man-made then a chocolate bar

chocolate bars have health risks.

A lot of what we're doing with GM crops (whether breeding or modern techniques) is removing fiber and adding sugar.  There are health risks to that.

with modern techniques and with cross breeding is the possibility for more concerning health risks, and so testing is required to ensure the food is safe.  You don't want to produce a new strain of something and have that strain be poisonous.  So we test to check for that.  Health risks exist and are mitigated with testing.

Part of the challenge with testing is over what period of time.  If you eat the food once maybe you are fine.  If you eat it every day for a 10 years maybe it increases your chances of cancer by 10%.   Because of the difficulty in this type of testing, we can't even agree on the health risk of very old foods.  We cannot agree on whether or not red meat is good or bad for you.  We don't know if Eggs are a part of a healthy diet.  There is debate about cows milk.  etc.  There are dozens of different diets and all of them have very limited support from science.

So I agree , per my understanding genetic engineering foods is a great thing, but;

Wealth gap: at the moment the only people that can afford to genetically modify crops are not necessarily driven by the right motives, for instance the greatest benefits are likely to areas of the third world; growing food/clean water where they have none, but research seems to solely focused on the interests of corporations not for the greater good.

Perceived authority: the anti GMO movement is very similar/shared groups with the anti vax movement. I think handling public education needs to be well thought out.

7144,7144,dbashf,"Genetic modification of food plants is not inherently safe, but can be made so through judicious application and use.  The reasons we generally don't have massive health problems from GM food consumption are because (1) we regulate their use and (2) the risks are admittedly low-probability events.  

I can think of three examples where GMO can cause health problems.  

1.  Transfer of allergenicity:  transferring genes from a commonly allergy-causing plant product to one that doesn't can cause unexpected allergic reactions from the consumption of latter.  A person with a nut allergy should be able to expect that an apple won't cause an allergic reaction in them.  This is the case because safety has been achieved by avoiding transfer of commonly allergic plant genes to ones that aren't, and if done, by making sure that the transferred gene's protein isn't the offending protein.  GMOs are also subject to allergy testing protocols, unlike plants modified through traditional breeding methods for this reason.  

2.  Gene transfer:  while genetic material is broken down into nucleic acids before absorption into the body, bacteria lining the gastrointestinal tract can incorporate genes.  This would be problematic if antibiotic resistance genes, sometimes used as markers in the GMO creation process, get incorporated.  Again, probability is low, and is further minimized by discouraging use of such markers.  

3.  >Making a plant produce a natural pesticide is also harmless to humans WE ARE NOT INSECTS...    

As a general rule, what's harmful to insets is usually harmful to humans also.  This is why there are warning labels all over RAID to keep away from children, etc.  Toxins of 1 particular bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis) has been found to be harmful to insets but not humans, and the gene for its toxin is used almost exclusively in GMOs.  Genetic modification to make plants produce insect toxins isn't safe because we're not insects, but because we wisely choose what to and what not to add.   

>Adding a gene does not alter the plant outside of that gene. Unless the modification is flawed, wich can be found out be testing the thing like any other food.    

The above examples cover situations where genetic modification succeeded in achieving intended goals of pest or disease resistance, etc (thus not flawed) but can cause health issues.  

That said, genetic modification has benefits - reduced need for insecticides and herbicides, increased crop yields and increasing the availability of arable lands that were previously subject to high pest/weed pressure.  Since it is no small human achievement that we avoided Malthus' apocalypse of population growth outpacing food production, I do believe genetic modification of crops should continue.     

I do think however, that genetic modification is indeed different from traditional breeding methods.  Former can involve the insertion of foreign genes, while latter is a selection of naturally evolved genes.  Safety of GMOs depends on wise practice of modification.  Producers of GMOs are also usually market incentivized to create GMOs that have minimal adverse health effects and via regulation.  

However, market conditions that incentivize the contrary are conceivable, where the financial benefits of higher crop yields outweigh the liabilities of adverse health effects.  [Furthermore, safety and testing requirements can be lobbied away or reduced via lobbying.](https://futurism.com/genetically-modified-meat-fda-usda)  Since safety depends on regulation and is not inherent to genetic modification itself, and since Monsanto has a public image problem, a market exists for non-GM foods.     
Testing is also key, because aggregate effects of consuming a plant with a gene for bacterial insect toxin might differ from that of consuming the toxin itself.  Gene might express unpredictably, producing other proteins in addition to the toxin, etc.  

So while I agree that most of the time, GM plants are effectively safe for consumption, I think that is because of the way we practice genetic modification and not because dangers are inherently impossible.  Safety of GM foods, particularly livestock, seems less of a certainty than OP indicates, and I think opponents do raise valid concerns.",1

 * **Dose.** Consumers ingest maybe 0.5mg of glyphosate per day. The highest levels you're ever really going to be exposed to are on grains which have been dessicated recently, which is uncommon, but let's use a hyperbolized example of a constant diet of 1,000ppm. Glyphosate is going to inhibit its target enzyme, EPSPS, at a 1:1 ratio. Bacterial cells will have hundreds to thousands of copies of EPSPS, and there are millions of bacteria present. EPSPS activity is inhibited at low-micromolar levels of glyphosate - but 1,000pm is about 0.006 micromolar. **Even ignoring all dilution effects, the highest raw levels of gly you would ever put in your mouth are about a thousand times too low to inhibit EPSPS activity in your gut.**

 * **Kinetics.** Glyphosate is a competitive inhibitor of EPSPS. This means it binds at the active site of the enzyme, where the reaction is catalyzed - where amino acid precursors (shiikimate-3-P) bind. ""Competitive"" because it has to compete for the active site, which means that kinetic (and thermodynamic) effects come in to play. If there is a huge excess of S-3-P around, which there absolutely will be, then most EPSPS will be bound to that instead of glyphosate.

 * **Microbiota features.** We all shed a huge percentage of our microbiota each day, so killing off even a large percentage of microbes is unlikely to have serious effects. After people have taken a strong course of antibiotics, it usually only takes a couple weeks of eating your regular diet to re-establish your healthy biome. Also, many families of bacteria in your stomach simply won't be inhibited by glyphosate because they either have a variant of EPSPS or an alternative pathway. These cells will contribute to the dilution of glyphosate in your gut lumen.

 * **Epidemiological studies.** Glyphosate has been studied more exhaustively than perhaps any other agricultural chemical. [Here are some meta-reviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HtDwBiotechDeniers/comments/46smmm/safety_of_glyphosate/) There are entire textbooks on the subject.

 * [After almost forty years of commercial use, and multiple regulatory approvals including toxicology evaluations, literature reviews, and numerous human health risk assessments, the clear and consistent conclusions are that glyphosate is of low toxicological concern, and no concerns exist with respect to glyphosate use and cancer in humans.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)

7200,7200,dbashf,If the potential for that risk is higher then it should be factored into account. We've been breeding plants naturally from many hundreds of years. We have a very good idea of how it works and the general pool of characteristics that we can generate. When you are editing directly or inserting from different life forms that's unknown territory where the potential risk is far far higher due to our relative lack of knowledge. Both can create unknown unknowns. One is far more likely to.,1
7201,7201,dbashf,I meant to express my annoyance as a consumer at the things the crops are being selectively bred for. Instead of getting tasty nutritious produce we get stuff that was only selected to withstand getting slammed around in machinery. Obviously they need to make money but they don’t seem to care anymore if the end product is worth eating as long as it’s stable. You used to be able to buy tasty local produce at the grocery stores but now if you want flavor you have to grow it yourself because the mega farms have a better margin with the tough tasteless stuff. It’s definitely cheaper but it isn’t better. I’d like to see an effort made to make our food quality better not just easier to sell.,1

It's important that researchers are held to that responsibility, and they are.

7212,7212,dbashf,">>I can think of three examples where GMO can cause health problems.

>All three of those examples also apply to non-GMOs though...  

I'm sorry if I wasn't clear, but these risks are unique to GMOs.  
With allergenicity, it was a hypothetical example, but someone with a nut allergy can eat apples, unless nut genes have been transferred to a GMO apple.  As I said, they generally don't do these kind of gene transfers, but it's not impossible to do - so this is an inherent risk of GMO's that non-GMO foods don't share.  

Transfer of antibiotic resistance - antibiotic resistance genes are used as markers for gene transfer and this is a risk unique to genetic modification.  Most studies do say that while these genes can and do transfer to gastrointestinal bacteria, the effect of this is dwarfed by the effect of artificial selection in GI bacteria due to wide-spread antibiotic use in the medical community.  I was trying to illustrate that there is a difference between presence of small, theoretical risk, and the entire absence of it, even if the risk is small enough to not make a functional difference, and these differences have to be studied long term.  

Insect toxin genes - as far as inserting genes to produce toxins into a crop/fruit, the risks seem obvious and heavily dependent on the selectivity of the toxin.  

>>while latter is a selection of naturally evolved genes.

>It isn't very ""naturally evolved"" when farmers bombard seeds with radiation to cause widespread mutations...

Selective breeding involves breeding for desirable traits - but the genes for these traits reside within the gene pool of the species.  Mutations are also a part of the natural evolutionary process that introduces new variations of existing genes/traits, but generally don't produce transgenic plants, like fluorescent flowers or whatever.  I don't really know how farmers bombarded seeds with radiation to cause widespread mutations.  GMO manufacturers usually work on single cells, and then grow those into full plants.  

I still think that GM foods are different enough from non-GMO foods to present risks unique to them.  GMO foods certainly are made safe for consumption through judicious practice of modification and study.  I also don't think that they are inherently unsafe, but they do present inherent risks which must be controlled.",1

Transcriptomics can ensure that there aren't any RNA abnormalities that would cause those proteins in the first place.

Problem with this all (and your whole argumentation) is, we are so afraid for modern GM techniques that we test it rigorously, whereas conventional food is constantly modified with traditional breeding techniques and yet always considered as safe without testing.

As a general rule, tests conducted on genetically modified foods are not applied to breeding wise modified food. As WHO writes, when there are concerns about safety governments will be sometimes, but not always, asked to test them. As such, we have a way better understanding of the effects of genetic modification than of the effect of breeding wise modifications.

**The European Commission**: ”The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” 

**American Council on Science and Health**: ”The consensus of scientific opinion is that the application of genetic modification technology introduces no unique food safety or environmental impact concerns and that there is no evidence of harm fromthose products that have been through a regulatory approval process.""

**Society of Toxicology**: ”Scientific analysis indicates that the process of GM food production is unlikely to lead to hazards of a different nature than those already familiar to toxicologists. The level of safety of current GM foods to consumers appears to be equivalent to that of traditional foods.”

Using Karen as an example, if enough people are Karens then vaccines would have no demand and will eventually cease to be produced. I see what you're getting at though.

We both agree that science doesn't need everyone to agree with it, and that's the point. It's the same thing with the Supreme Court, who can similarly present their findings but are unable to enforce them. It's really shitty that certain politicians, corporations, media, and Karens do what they do, but if we do the same thing then we're just lending legitimacy to the parts of their arguments that don't deserve it.

I might completely misunderstand what breeding entails, but as far as I know you cannot be very specific for which genes you introduce in the specie with breeding. Something you can be with genetic modification. As genes are massively complex, I think the risk of introducing wanted and unwanted genes in a species is more risky than one or a few specific ones.

Moreover, I specifically said **frivolous lawsuits**. You know, like when people claim the vaccine gave their kid autism.

>What are the scientists names? What research did they ""prove""?

You're welcome to peruse the literature on PubMed, Google Scholar, or whatever you prefer. There are hundreds of studies to choose from, there are even entire textbooks just about glyphosate.

I think the ""best"" study is by the National Cancer Institute from 2018, which examined more than 50,000 farm workers.

[Among 54 251 applicators, 44 932 (82.8%) used glyphosate, including 5779 incident cancer cases (79.3% of all cases). **In unlagged analyses, glyphosate was not statistically significantly associated with cancer at any site**. However, among applicators in the highest exposure quartile, there was an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with never users (RR = 2.44, 95% CI = 0.94 to 6.32, Ptrend = .11), though this association was not statistically significant. Results for AML were similar with a five-year (RRQuartile 4 = 2.32, 95% CI = 0.98 to 5.51, Ptrend = .07) and 20-year exposure lag (RRTertile 3 = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.05 to 3.97, Ptrend = .04).](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/4590280?searchresult=1)

That said, it's difficult for laypersons to interpret scientific data so I tend to prefer citing the stance of major scientific agencies that have distilled the data into more accessible language:


**World Health Organization**: [""In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.""](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)

When we discuss the nature of modifying crops we're worried about the large scale distribution. 

That's why speed is a problem. If issues present over years of consumption then a system where you use progressive generations should give better data sets to identify them.

Very true and I am in full agreement. I also admit it was my bad for bringing up vaccinations, since they're somewhat a dynamically dissimilar situation to the GMO issue, as you've pointed out. I am sorry. However, I don't think it is unreasonable of me to say that it's also possible for a reckless edition of a GMO to harm consumers if we're not careful. My argument is that we can't do away with constant testing lest we kill someone or worse. I don't want to be rude, but science is about learning, challenging, and experimenting for eternity, effectively questioning what we know in the pursuit of knowledge. Very few things are postulation, and rightly so.
 
>I'm fine with the continuation of studies for any product. I'm just against it being a prerequisite for establishing safety.

I see your point, and I agree with the sentiment that it's not right to have safety gridlock. That's kind of my point though. There is no problem that I see with the system of scrutiny from a conceptual perspective, but after reading your points I admit that like other systems it can be easily taken advantage of to push interests out of its intended bounds. I agree that this is a big problem and is worthy of being addressed and rectified properly--and as soon as possible. I don't think, however, that getting in a flame war with a Karen is going to help achieve that just as being an outspoken politician fighting the establishment at every turn is (from what I've seen) going to achieve that. I feel that the best way to change things is to play the system until they find themselves out of power (choosing battles along the way), then rectify the situation while reinforcing what we already know to be true. Getting angry about it and suppressing their voices to me only gives them fodder to claim oppression, and that hurts our cause because technically they're not wrong. I don't always like playing by those rules, but it's what we have and its purpose is to allow for truth to prevail. This isn't a debate about the politics of national administration though, it's about the necessity of proving legitimacy under constant scrutiny in regards to scientific findings.

>the ship has sailed on GMO scientific safety, no one proposes a arguments of why they need a legal hurdle to prove their safety. It's been a quarter century of legally mandated tests, it's time for the legal mandate to come off.

I'm disagreeing with this. Firstly, (as you've already argued) I'd like to address the Karens. Them and scientists like the dude who published the now-disproven autism-vaccine link are putting forward plenty arguments. They may be ridiculous arguments, but they're arguments nonetheless and I think it's important that we continue to disprove them and disassemble them, demonstrating again and again that truth is about proof and rigorous testing as opposed to a devolving into a battle of unsubstantiated claims each side considers a postulation.

Also, there was once a point in time when phrenology was considered legitamate without mandated tests of said legitamacy. After at least a century of psuedoscientists using this (at the time) universally-accepted truth-of-concept to justify racism and the subjugation/exploitation of other humans, someone eventually proved in the court of scrutiny that all this so-called science supporting racial superiority was bullshit, and they did it with overwhelming evidence and support. it didn't stop there, either. Through WWII, through the 60's, through the 90's, and even today we continue to do the same thing, and it is 100% necessary--dare I say imperative--that we continue to do so. If we come to a point where we stop examining everything we learn, then that could be real bad for everyone involved. That's what they want, and that is the Stone Age you fear.

Tldr: While I agree with most of your points and recognize better the hand third parties have in how scientific findings are recieved, I still think that we should keep the necessity of constant, meticulous testing to continuously make sure that we're covering our bases.

Well that's the rub right there GMO are no more likely to have deliterious effects than non GMO, mandated testing makes an inherent assumption that it does. The world currently holds the opinion that it is safer to blast seeds with radiation then to edit genes, inherently. This is a false predicate and has to be addressed. The world believes that selective breeding is safer than GMO's, this is totally unfounded and not born out by the facts. When you say there's a chance we might kill someone, we've literally bred potatoes with conventional breeding that were poisonous, unless people are advocating that they want to put the same screws on selective breeding as GMO then we should end the mandate on testing.

>but science is about learning, challenging, and experimenting for eternity, effectively questioning what we know in the pursuit of knowledge

Science can be as eternal and questioning as it wants. You're confusing the fixed regulatory burden of ""safety"" with the scientific one. There is no boundary for science and that's why people still study evolution. In regulation there is a point were you have to decide a product is safe for the public. GMO has met that burden, it can be treated like any other crop. 

>don't think, however, that getting in a flame war with a Karen is going to help achieve that

Karen's don't get a voice, there's no flame war because they can do whatever they want and not eat GMO. The United States however must decide in q scientific manner why they are burdening this technology and none other. Europe seems to feel no need to be legally coherent but you have to ask yourself why is blasting plant x with radiation organic and not subjected to test but this GMO thing is. Why is a processes that has knowlingly poisoned people via potatoes safer than all GMO technology. You cannot logically justify this, Europe is twisting itself into a pretzel by saying that mutagenesis has a long safety record, yet when one asks can we see it they have nothing. Supplicating to Karen isn't going to achieve what you want either.

>an outspoken politician fighting the establishment at every turn is (from what I've seen) going to achieve that. I feel that the best way to change things is to play the system until they find themselves out of power (choosing battles along the way), then rectify the situation while reinforcing what we already know to be true.

No, slow incremental change emboldens the opposition into a false sense of parity with the truth. Being passive in both politics and science is how you get both Karen and Donald Trump. I don't want to shut anyone's voice but lies are not the same as the truth and no one should coddle the wrong party. President Obama tried your political approach and Republicans spat in his face and laughed. Hillary Clinton also wanted slow gradual change but couldn't win against Trump. This is because people like Karen see any attempt at compromise as a weakness there is no reciprocation for good deeds. Don't replicate the actions of Karen, but set boundaries and declare were going to do x, if you don't want to you have every option to y. 

>Them and scientists like the dude who published the now-disproven autism-vaccine link are putting forward plenty arguments. They may be ridiculous arguments, but they're arguments nonetheless and I think it's important that we continue to disprove them and disassemble them

I don't disagree with that, but you'll realize that our assesment of vaccine safety isn't informed by Jenny McCarthy, scientist can and must fight public dangers like that. But regulatory processes are the lever of our economic system, I'm not going to have those levers controlled by Jenny or Karen. You can talk and I'll debate you, but the facts control the levers and science has emphatically rested on the side of GM. If Karen and the OCA want to test food, well test every single breeding type and we won't arbitrarily include just one. The OCA can now explain to the public why their mutagenic crops are exempt from this.

>If we come to a point where we stop examining everything we learn, then that could be real bad for everyone involved.

But I don't want people to stop critizing ideas, you can do that with out it being part of regulation. If scientist A wants to launch a study comparing GMO with an isogenic counterpart he should and I support him. When reconsidering regulation though there is a point were we say this technology is safe enough not to need special scrutiny. GMO have reached that regulatory step. It isn't required to test them because the risk are similar. Test all or none any thing else panders to a lie. Since we can't/ wont test all we test none (regulatory tests).",1

1. No shit, from first glance, but you can't reasonably believe that GMO's are less likely to have issues, can you? Non-GMO apples have been consumed for several centuries and are therefore thoroughly safe for us to eat compared to any altered apple, but GMO engineers are looking to grow them faster, bigger, more diverse, and more resilient through a faster and more precise method than selective breeding. That's all good in my book (I encourage it, actually) but gene-editing is not subject to the same limitations that breeding has and while selective breeding also has cases of adverse effects in its products, the natural processes of breeding will normally prevent certain results from occuring because that's nature weighing in. Gene-editing works by cut-and-paste, purposefully bypassing those limitations in the hopes of making something beyond nature (hopefully better), but considering all that you can't reasonably argue that it isn't 10000x easier to make errors in doing this, considering how little we know when it comes to the purpose of a significant number of genes and how every gene interacts/relates with another/several others. For instance, if a faster-growing apple has a hidden property that when coming into contact with my internal chemistry triggers an allergic reaction (specific to me and a population of others with similar relevent chemistry) that didn't appear in mandated testing due to a lack of repetitive and diverse testing, that's not a good edition of apple and it should be discontinued or avoided by certain individuals such as myself. Now, consider the problems we face if that allergic reaction was so intense that it put me, an individual with supposedly no prior allergies, into a reaction state that--when I consume the apple--kills me? If there were enough tests done repetitively/diversely before I ate that apple, my life would be saved. Now consider that the chance of that reaction occuring was 1/10000. It wouldn't happen every time, but it'd be like playing Russian roulette with an assassin no one is aware of. If a scientist were to do the same test for that reaction 100000000000 times, they have a better chance of catching that and saving my life. Now consider that the reaction triggers, but its onset is so slow that I only start being affected by it a month later. No one would suspect that the apple would have been the cause of my demise and they'll probably just chalk my death up to ""mysterious causes"" (sounds pretty Stone-age-y to me). Re-testing already-cleared apples would save my life in that situation. The problem is that it can get far more complex than that. This is why we have the field of research and this is why continuous testing is so important.

2. To say that mandated testing is assuming that GMO's are unsafe is somewhat true, but is nevertheless an over-generalization. Mandated testing is the acknowledgement that there is an unknown aspect of what we're testing, and while it's good to explore and continue in an edition's use it is necessary to approach it with a responsible amount of caution instead of falling prey to our hubris. I'd even argue that it is so much more necessary in this case now that we have humans added to the mix. Treating each edition as if there was a hidden problem that we're not seeing is one way to look at it, but it isn't unreasonable always. Once testing is convincing enough at its current stage, then trials of increasing stages can be done--one after another--until there is enough trust in the edition's properties to have it be introduced to humans in a controlled testing environment.

3. Regarding your article:

>“there’s actually a lot more risk and uncertainty with conventional breeding, than there is with genetic modification. That’s because, with GM, you’re mucking about with a single gene. There are a lot more genes in play with conventional breeding, and a lot more ways that surprising genetic interactions could come back to haunt you.”

We aren't ""mucking about with a single gene"" with gene-editing. Genes relate to each other, and it's extremely difficult to express 1 trait alone in a complex organism like a plant or animal through the activation/deactivation/relocation of a single gene. Genes relate and interact with each other in complex ways, often so subtly that people don't notice. (FYI boingboing.net is not a credible source, neither is a biased activism site.)

I'm going to bring vaccines into this again because I think it further demonstrates my point (for the record, I think vaccines are a-okay). The issue that we have with ""Karens"" is a result of a disregard for the adequately-convincing results produced by mandated testing of all the vaccines we typically have in clinical practice (tetanus, HPV, meningitis, etc., Which are also subject to new testing by the way, since pathogens are constantly mutating--at times to adapt to the already-vaccine-boosted antibodies. Tetanus-vaccine-A may be okay, but what about Tetanus-vaccine-B?), specifically the trials that adequately exclude autism from the list of side effects each vaccine is directly and (as far as we can tell) indirectly responsible for. Scientists continue testing in these areas, however, to make sure and further prove that autism doesn't occur in individualized cases due to some indirect reaction that we could have missed. As of now, all credible scientific results on autism (a very complex neurodevelopmental disorder) itself point to the onset of symptoms typically occurring after birth before the age of 3, though recent findings say its cause is very possibly genetic and therefore likely has a pre-natal determination instead of being caused by something like a vaccine. My point is that the most we can say is that we have no credible evidence to demonstrate that the vaccines we have in use cause autism, so it's safe to say that they do not do so. We are agreement on this. Karens are putting an unattainable burden of proof on vaccines, and I'd argue that people are doing the same with GMO's, for the most part. We are also in agreement on this. However, GMO's are far newer than vaccines, both in product and in production, so I don't think it is totally unreasonable to have skepticism in the safety of new editions. This is where we disagree, since I think it's especially reasonable that we continue to test even already in-practice products, because we have very little knowledge of genetics and therefore have a responsibility to compensate for that lack of knowledge by looking for things we may have missed post-production.

>The world currently holds the opinion that it is safer to blast seeds with radiation then to edit genes, inherently.

>they have a long proven safety record

This is literally what I'm saying. ""Blasting seeds with radiation"" wasn't accepted overnight, it was just one of the earliest methods available as we moved into the newer edition of the field of specialised genetic alteration that, by the way, demonstrated its superiority to selective breeding through the means of mandated testing and continues to do so even after being generally accepted as the superior method. Each new sample created is tested literally thousands of times before it even leaves the initial lab for further trials, and still many more before it even begins development in another. It is imperitive that it is tested every step of the way. Nothing is a postulation.

Side note: CRISPR and the seeds are deemed safe for human exposure. Arguing solely that one is less safe than another because one is in human trials is a dead end.

Another example of my point: radiation therapy is a form of radiation bombardment used to attack cancer cells. It is widely accepted and has stood up to decades of mandated testing to gain our trust in its degree of safety and effectiveness. However, you can bet your ass any discovered method claiming superiority to it will absolutely be subject to mandated testing even after proving itself, because each person is different and there are too many variables to consider (when it comes to how it will affect an individual) to stop testing all pathways available, including new ones that are discovered every day. By not doing so, portions of our population are put at great risk due to negligence.

> There is no boundary for science and that's why people still study evolution. In regulation there is a point were you have to decide a product is safe for the public. GMO has met that burden, it can be treated like any other crop. 

I see first your point and concede on that. We are in agreement. However, (while, again, I agree that GMO's are safe) I have to disagree with the statement that claims that GMO's as a whole have met that burden. The GMO's we have now may have met that burden, but new editions will without a doubt be created and my view is that they should be accepted by the public just like they accept vaccines (excluding Karens, of course), prescription medication, cosmetics, etc. : with an understanding that they require adequate, meticulous, rigorous, and constant testing with each introduction of a new edition because genetics is a higher level of science that we have just started to break the surface of.

What's more, certain products that people generally accept are recalled for causing ""unforseen health complications"", and the science that goes into those is like kiddieland compared to the science that GMO's deal in. Just as I said in my first comment: we should accept GMO's, but with a lot more extreme caution. This is a field we are comparatively super inexperienced in and we shouldn't get comfortable too fast. If people are still skeptical, let them be. They'll accept it eventually, even despite political horseshit.

I mean there are people who are living with those genetic mistakes right now. And plants definitely are. I'm glad we got to the Crux of this because this is actually a place were you're wrong.

>reasonably argue that it isn't 10000x easier to make errors in doing this,

I will argue just that and I'll give you the conclusion of 280 different scientific associations just to bolster that point. If companies were doing this randomly without looking at the results of agree with you. But they want the genetic architecture to be the exact same and so they compare the genome of each, and they compare protiens of each to ensure parity. They wouldn't need regulations to do this, just the threat of being sued and losing an already frightened public.

>considering how little we know when it comes to the purpose of a significant number of genes and how every gene interacts/relates with another/several others.

We blast and cut open nucleuses of plants to fuse them, how is one ok to you while the other needs regulation. Let's do a thought experiment and let's say eugenics was legal. Do you think there is more danger in randomly breeding to people to have strong children or ( let's say we found the genes) selecting genes that we can bring in from the strongest humans and placing them in a fetus. We'll make it somatic instead of germline, meaning no generational effects for the "" GMO "" human.  This is basically what you're saying is better.

>For instance, if a faster-growing apple has a hidden property that when coming into contact with my internal chemistry triggers an allergic reaction 

Just like the celery I just told you about.

>If there were enough tests done repetitively/diversely before I ate that apple, my life would be saved

How many tests would be required to make sure that chemistry and genetics of 7.5 billion people were accounted for and why does it only apply to genetic modification, when just gave you an example of it happening twice in selective. Let's apply your connundrum to drug testing how much money would it cost to develop drugs using your new method? Would any drug be cleared knowing that everyone reacts to things differently and that there are people who react badly to pure water. How do you plan to make any viable product. This is why we don't let people regulate items, they're neurotic and will brow beat something in a test that nothing can pass.

>If there were enough tests done repetitively/diversely before I ate that apple, my life would be saved.

How many would be enough though how many chemical perturbations do you have to account for in a population of 7.5B. why does it only apply to one breeding technique. These are questions you have to answer.

>If a scientist were to do the same test for that reaction 100000000000 times, they have a better chance of catching that and saving my life.

How much does 10000000000000000 test cost. And what is 100000000000000000000 is the number that's needed to find out if it's dangers. There are 43 quintillion ways to orient a rubix  cube. How many ways do you think every metabolite of food you eat interacts with your body. And again why is this only applies to one breeding technique.

>Re-testing already-cleared apples would save my life in that situation. The problem is that it can get far more complex than that. This is why we have the field of research and this is why continuous testing is so important

Are purposefully ignoring me, PEOPLE WILL STILL TEST, IT IS HOWEVER NOT A REQUISITE FOR YOU TO EAT FOOD.

>To say that mandated testing is assuming that GMO's are unsafe is somewhat true, but is nevertheless an over-generalization

If you mandate testing only on GMO and not selective breeding is an assumption that selective breeding is innately safe. How am I overgeneralizing that's an undeniable fact.

>Mandated testing is the acknowledgement that there is an unknown aspect of what we're testing

And this unknown aspect only exists in GMO food and not any other techniques. You can blast plants with radiation and still sell them without a care in the world. There is an unknown aspect in literally everything choosing one thing to single out with no evidence is called bias. Selective breeding isn't safer than GMO inherently.

>it with a responsible amount of caution instead of falling prey to our hubris.

14,000 years of hubris is what agriculture is. It saying I hate having to wait for mother nature to provide buffalo and deer and bitter berries, I'm going to change it to suit me, I don't give a shit about nature I'm taking care of myself and I don't care about what species I change/ hurt. Hubris is in our DNA if we face consequences then we face them, but let's not pretend that GMO is hubristic and we've only been working hand in hand with nature until

>done--one after another--until there is enough trust in the edition's properties to have it be introduced to humans in a controlled testing environment.

Right but outside of tests specific to GMO such as purity tests what else can they be expected to test for? 

Crops are tested for a variety of features depending on what's desired. Bigger tomatoes can be achieved view 3 primary methods. 

- selection. Save the seeds from the plants that grow the features you like and after 5-10 generations you should have a stable open pollinated variety. These are often called op or heirloom seeds. 

- F1 hybrid. Deliberately pollinate related but dissimilar plants *(two varieties of tomatoes for example)* to create a single generation seed that will have known characteristics. This is one of the more popular methods and can be repeated year on year to tweak and refine the end crop. For instance i might use a male f4 of variety A on a female p1 of crop B to get an F1 hybrid seed of large fathers totally rad tomatoes. To the best of my knowledge it's common practice to grow these for a few seasons to test taste, consistency, cold hardiness, allergy potential, etc. We do expect that these react similarly to other tomatoes though because only tomatoe genetics were used. The seeds from f1 hybrids aren't true to type however and won't grow the same if saved unlike open pollinated varieties. Seeds often revert back to their P1 female variety iirc. 

- Gmo crops insert genetics from outside the genetic pool of the current crop to create new traits. While useful, not enough is known about the long term effects to make the claim that there is no danger. This is especially true when these seeds cross pollinate into wild stock or the p7 or p8 version of the same manipulated seed. That's why many gmo seeds are created to be sterile however that's not fool proof and it's been shown already that some gmo seed stock is getting into the wild. 

That is my entire point in a nut shell. We can't test for unknown unknowns and so while we do tests for known issues that is only part of the problem. 

I'm not shitting on GMOs i think that we need to be looking more into them because they can do great things. (Golden rice) but they are far from fully understood and any claim to the contrary doesn't seem supported by evidence.",1

It's important to note the difference because open pollinated seeds are in effect not really being modified they are simply having a selection pressure applied. This isn't really genetic modification as it's the same variety grown year on year. For the purposes of this conversation they feel irrelevant. I will fully admit that I'm not aware of any testing done on these varieties however the long cycle time and the fact that these are often consumed by the grower themselves does offer anecdotal testing over time. 

Hybrid seeds are often tested however, often for seed quality and purity. [here is an example of one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423813001301) in this case via similar methods to Gmo seeds (PCR screening)

>This is my key point, if these features are so important why not making sure everything adheres ro these standards. By making exceptions you are actually stating that the standards we hold GMO are irrelevant/not important.

I'm not making that argument despite being accused of it several times. My point is that regardless of testing the potential for harm is increased when you increase the potential genetic markers available for interaction. If all crops were tested identically the risk of an adverse effect appearing is still higher in gmo crops that insert non native genetic material.",0

Really weird sentence, it is my argument (which I am literally stating my saying my keypoint is) so how I am accusing you of it being your argument is a bit beyond my comprehension. The only thing I am constantly stating is that, why I keep repeating my point, your argumentation constantly goes around out it and is highly confusing in regard to my key point.

For example: when I stated it should be similarly tested and holded to the exact same standard, you stated (that you are also in favor of testing and) that as a matter of fact it is tested, which I doubt and goes directly against my argument as it assumes it is not tested yet. Than you constantly make this inconsitant claim:
> when you increase the potential genetic markers available for interaction.

Because first of all, genetic modification is not necessarily about introducing genetic markers. That you only regard this part of genetic modification and completely neglect the silincing of genes. So you argument falls short. Second, this argument seems to suggest that with breeding no additional genetic markers are added, while changing the genetic make up and adding new non-native markers is the whole point. I believe that (as stated before that) with genetic modification you introduce less and only specific genetic markers to the new specie than with breeding you suggest with this claim that genetic modification is less dangourous, and so far you have not been able to provide a rational for your feat why the genetic markers introduced with genetic modification are more dangerous than those introduced by breeding.

The only way I can comprehent your arhumentation is by the assumption that you feel that cisgenisis is more dangerous than transgenesis and that breeding is about cisgenesis and genetic modification about transgenesis. If this is true your argumentation falls short simply on the fact the targeted genes or characteristics between breeding and genetic modification are not necessarily different. Than your speed argument comes in, as gm is doing exact same thing as breeding (introducing the exact same genes) but a bit faster. But as it involves the exact same genes, you have still not provided a rational why the exact same genes have a more dangerous in a fast process than in a slow process. Which I still can not comprehent as I have. Ever learned that the same genes introduced into the same DNA can have a different effect due to the process of how it is introduced. I simply cannot believe that claim.",0

7303,7303,dbashf,">Because first of all, genetic modification is not necessarily about introducing genetic markers. 

I don't think the there is any inherent danger in turning genes off. Maybe I've misunderstood the science but i dont see that this is the relevant part of the discussion. 

>Second, this argument seems to suggest that with breeding no additional genetic markers are added, while changing the genetic make up and adding new non-native markers is the whole point. 

No. My point is not and has never been that breeding naturally adds no genetic information, only that any genetic information used must come from existing crops within that family and phylogenetic clade. 

>...and so far you have not been able to provide a rational for your feat why the genetic markers introduced with genetic modification are more dangerous than those introduced by breeding. (Sic)

Because the potential pool of genetic information being chosen from is larger when scientists choose from bacteria or animals as examples. This is genetic information that wasn't ""available"" if bred normally. I don't think that this is a difficult concept. It's the complex web of potential interactions that is the danger here. Since a tomatoe couldn't normally be pollinated by a bacteria that result isn't possible in nature. Therefore any genetic material that we insert that isn't native (which is what many of the more interesting GMOs do) increases the potential knock on effect because of this new trait that we've shifted from one clade to another. 

>The only way I can comprehent your arhumentation is by the assumption that you feel that cisgenisis is more dangerous than transgenesis and that breeding is about cisgenesis and genetic modification about transgenesis. (Sic)

No. Genetic material is genetic material. My point is that gm crops amplify an existing potential danger by increasing the possible ways in which that crop now interacts with things (bugs, humans, ecosystem etc) because genetic material it didn't have access to is being added to the potential pool of traits it can manifest. 

>But as it involves the exact same genes, you have still not provided a rational why the exact same genes have a more dangerous in a fast process than in a slow process. 

While you could use gm to create crops using the same genes as traditional methods, why would you? It's true that genetic material is all created of the same chemical components but when i talk genes and genetic material i mean the expression/effect of those genes and not the base components as is everyone else.

[Brain activity and structure in transgender adolescents more closely resembles the typical activation patterns of their desired gender, according to new research.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)

[Spanish investigators—led by psychobiologist Antonio Guillamon of the National Distance Education University in Madrid and neuropsychologist Carme Junqu Plaja of the University of Barcelona—used MRI to examine the brains of 24 female-to-males and 18 male-to-females—both before and after treatment with cross-sex hormones. Their results, published in 2013, showed that even before treatment the brain structures of the trans people were more similar in some respects to the brains of their experienced gender than those of their natal gender. For example, the female-to-male subjects had relatively thin subcortical areas (these areas tend to be thinner in men than in women). Male-to-female subjects tended to have thinner cortical regions in the right hemisphere, which is characteristic of a female brain. (Such differences became more pronounced after treatment.)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/)

7372,7372,yh173w,"If you are doing any serious work that requires close to 8 hours of solid work,  don't do it.

I have been remote working for the last 6 years. The setup is important for my productivity, big display, fast internet, detached keyboard etc. 

Slow internet, bad chair, distraction from the folks who travel with you make it not worth it. Also you need to figure out when you are going to go out, eat outside etc. 

Instead take a month vacation and travel as much as you want. 

The nomadic lifestyle wouldn't work for everyone. But if you are a creative type who needs to work only for a few hours a day, may be worth trying.",2
7373,7373,yh173w,"Good advice. I was hoping to learn about free tools available to help plan better. For e.g. you mentioned about slow internet. One possible reason could be bad cellular network. I wanted one online service where I can check this data for myself and exclude areas with bad coverage from the plan...I thought there'd be an independent non-allied, non-profit organization behind this already...",1

>Specifically, the Paris conference is to focus on helping Ukraine meet its needs for water, power, food, health and transport during the coming months through to the end of March.

>Sweden was among the first nations attending the meeting to pledge more aid. Its foreign trade minister, Johan Forssell, announced a contribution of 55 million euros (US$58 million) for humanitarian aid and the rebuilding of schools, hospitals and energy infrastructure.

>As winter bites, “we need to do whatever we can to help improve conditions in Ukraine and also help them to fight off the Russian invaders,” he said. “We’re here for them as long as it takes.”

>&nbsp;

>The meeting also aims to put in a place a system to coordinate international aid this winter, mirroring the way that Western nations supplying weapons coordinate their military support. 

>A web-based platform will enable Ukraine to list its civilian aid needs, and allow donors to show what they’ll supply in response.

>The conference’s French organizers say they are expecting more than 45 nations and 20 international institutions to take part.

**Image Transcription**: Photo credit: Pedro Valtierra, Antonio Turok

[On this day](https://www.apeoplescalendar.org/calendar/day?month=1&day=1) in 1994, the same day that NAFTA took effect, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation declared war on the Mexican state, demanding ""work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace.""

Following this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records. The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.

The good old man told us that in the days food started to have an expiration date the people in power of these thing came for advice to the monasteries and abbeys, asking the monks if beer was food or drink. And as the new law said that all food must contain an expiration date. So it came to be, because the divine liquid was their daily bread.

So health departments use the rules they already have (for restaurants) and try to apply them to breweries.  The problem with that is, where does the right of enforcement start and end?

What is a tap line?  Well it's used to serve pre-packaged ""food"" by delivering beer from a tapped keg to the consumer.  So is it a utensil?  Like a glass?  If so, then the tap line must be cleaned and sanitized after every use just like a glass.  Brewers need to wear hair nets.  Cask beer must be kept refrigerated.  Say good bye to barrel aging.

**Image Transcription**: Photo credit: Pedro Valtierra, Antonio Turok

[On this day](https://www.apeoplescalendar.org/calendar/day/1-1) in 1994, the same day that NAFTA took effect, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation declared war on the Mexican state, demanding ""work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice and peace.""

Following this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records. The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.

> As Holloway and Peláez (1998) note, all too often, women experienced the harsh realities of poverty and poor health disproportionately. Today, 63% of all expectant mothers receive direct care from their local health promoter while only 35% of pregnancies are properly assisted in non-Zapatista communities. This leaves many women from pro-government communities more vulnerable to complications associated with childbirth (Arsenault, 2011; Thompson, Date N/A, The Melbourne Globalist). Autonomous healthcare is having a positive effect on women's and children's health. In regions where there were previously significantly high rates of death during childbirth, there has now been a period of eight years or more where no maternal deaths have been recorded (Thompson, Date N/A, the Melbourne Globalist). With the greater availability of local midwives and the basic medical knowledge provided by the health promoter, Zapatista women are now safely giving birth in their own communities, with a dramatically reduced risk of death. In addition to this, cancer screenings and sexual health examinations take place more frequently, further improving the quality of women's lives (Bellinghausen, 2009, febrero 26th). 

> With the wider availability of autonomous healthcare, 84% of Zapatista communities receive important vaccinations against diseases such as malaria (Castellanos, 2014). In pro-government communities that figure stands at only 75%, meaning that fewer of these community inhabitants have access to necessary vaccines despite the promises of State healthcare (Castellanos, 2014). A greater disparity is apparent between pro-government communities and Zapatista villages with regard to the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Currently, 32% of Zapatista inhabitants suffer TB while in larger portions of pro-government communities, a remarkable 84%, continue to experience this respiratory infection (Castellanos, 2014). It is clear, as these figures demonstrate, that Zapatista healthcare has a profound impact on the quality of the lives of the many indigenous who attend autonomous healthcare services regularly. Currently, 74% of Zapatista communities now have access to toilet facilities and this has lead to a vast improvement in personal hygiene (Arsenault, 2011). Only 54% of pro-government communities can claim access to toilet facilities in their homes (Arsenault, 2011).

> Figures released in 2001 indicate that 37% of all Zapatista students are now steadily progressing towards second level education (Thompson, Date N/A, the Melbourne Globalist). Nevertheless, according to Barmeyer's (2008) observations, primary school remains the only educational service that is available in all indigenous communities in the autonomous territory. However, despite its rudimentary infrastructure and under-resourced classrooms, autonomous education is a finely tuned system designed precisely to deliver the objectives the Zapatistas expected of it.

> Proclaimed as one of the greatest health achievements for the Zapatista movement, the eradication of both the manufacture and consumption of alcohol has significantly improved the health of all Zapatistas (Bellinghausen, 2009, marzo 7th). This no-tolerance policy is directly linked to the reduction in many illnesses and infections including “úlcera, cirrhosis, desnutrición y heridas con machete” (Bellinghausen, 2009, marzo 7th).",45

Socialism is an extremely broad term, going by the definition given here I'm not a socialist - which is strange considering I've been a socialist for years. Socialism is not ""the state owning the economy"" unless you want to argue that absolute monarchies in which the economy was ultimately owned by the king through the state was socialism. Remember the idea of free banking was actually originally a socialist idea.

Socialism simply says that no individual shall be able to further add to his riches except by labour - it is a war against usury and economic rent and ""the great Anti-Theft Movement"". It deprives capital of its privileges not labour of its product to paraphrase Tucker.

All the welfare programs need to adhere to is not kill the golden goose.

The UK is one example, there are plenty of places universal healthcare works far better than in the UK and the reasons for the current crisis in the NHS are complex. This also doesn't take away from the fact that the beveridge model is still better than the model in the US (but there are better models and we can improve upon the beveridge model too). 

&#x200B;

>Socialists will be the first to admit that welfare delays socialism indefinitely and makes the state forever dependant on capitalism succeeding to fund those welfare programs

This depends on the socialist, personally I agree that welfare and taxation don't have anything to do with socialism but I don't think most would say that it delays socialism. Looking at individuals like Gustov Moller and Ernst Wigforss (2 Swedish socialists who considered themselves Marxists) they argued that the welfare state was actually a jumping off point to achieve socialism by strengthening the power of labour to make it less dependent on private wage labour. Socialism is not welfare capitalism I agree, but socialism is also not state ownership of production or a command economy. There's more to socialism than ""Marxism-leninism"" and many pre Marxist socialists were radical free traders.

&#x200B;

Edit: While I'm highly critical of Marx I have read him extensively and until fairly recently I would have considered myself a Marxist so I'm familiar with what Marx wrote and why he was wrong but the article you linked here makes some mistakes and clearly isn't that familiar with the works of Marx.

This isn't really an argument. I guess I agree that politicians and individuals can mean well with certain policies and they sometimes don't work out (things like price controls come to mind). I do agree that socialism is associated with much that I oppose but that's irrelevant.

>Well, two things. The UK use to be one of the best between all OECD countries and every country that has government healthcare (including the US) has increased healthcare cost way above GDP growth. Meaning it is unsustainable in the long term.  


It's true the UKs healthcare system used to be better when it got more funding, it's obviously uncontroversial that services perform better when they receive more funding. Healthcare costs are increasing (in part due to an ageing population) but also due to rent seeking, patent laws on drugs leading to monopoly rent extraction, creeping occupational licensing. None of this is an argument against all government intervention in healthcare though, price transparency regulations are good, all payer rate setting is good as is community rating and automatic enrolment. Universal healthcare is a slam dunk obvious policy, I think you'd be hard pressed to find health econnomists that oppose some form of universal healthcare and of the people I know who are far more well versed in the topic than I none of them oppose universal healthcare. That's anecdotal but the polls by economists show this too: [https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/polls/by-topic/?fwp\_topics=healthcare-wellbeing](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/polls/by-topic/?fwp_topics=healthcare-wellbeing)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>They are wrong. Flat out.  


Okay? Again not really an argument, many socialist thinkers supported a form of welfare state - I'd recommend ""three worlds of welfare capitalism"" if you're interested in some of the theories behind this thinking. I don't necessarily agree with it in that I do think state welfare crowded out the fraternal societies, lodges, guilds etc that provided welfare but under the conditions of state capitalism, welfare is essential. But it's undeniable socialists across Europe established and supported welfare states (in a universal form). Even Marx advocated a minimum program that included welfare systems - he opposed the Bismarkian welfare system but not welfare states in general. 

&#x200B;

>But it was Lenin that popularised socialism for the world.  


So? I'm not even sure if this is true, if you ask the average person on the street who they most closely associate socialism with they'd  probably say Jeremy Corbyn or Sanders or something - I'm not sure how many people even know who Lenin was beyond ""that Russian guy"". But even if this is true, so what? 

Also socialism was a major force across the world in Russia that existed before Lenin. 

It kind of feels like you're arguing in bad faith here or maybe you don't actually know what socialism is. I'd recommend you read some Tucker, Proudhon, Carson, Henry George, Silvio Gesell, Joe Labadie, William Batchelder Greene, Thomas Hodgskin, Marx, Kropotkin, Malatesta, Bernstein, Kautsky, and Roemer just to name a few so you get a better understanding of what socialism is. Socialism is not the same thing as state ownership of the economy. 

It could be possible that we're talking past each other as you haven't given a definition of capitalism or socialism really.

Sounds like you did not read the link attached. Government services will ALWAYS, I repeat, ALWAYS increase in costs over time.. for the reasons stated in the link provided. 

If they increase in costs over time, objectively, then they are unsustainable.

... 

That's not true. If the costs increase over time but say for example land rents grow overtime (which they do) then taxation of such rents can fund services which in turn boosts land values which boosts tax revenue and so on. 

It's absolutely possible to set up self funding welfare programs (take a VAT or flat income tax in which the revenue is used to distribute a basic income to all based on the revenue of the tax). Just because costs increase, doesn't mean they're unsustainable. The kind of social insurance programs I'd like to see differ from what we have today anyway (I think Friedmans (UCC + NIT + LVT) would work well as a baseline for example. 

&#x200B;

>It is. Before the USSR, socialism was just a quirky movement. After it, several other countries implemented it, including China.  


This is a strange argument and is just not true at all. International Workingmen's Association in the 1860s had 8 million members, the German Marxist SDP also grew extremely quickly in the late 1870s and 1880s to the point Bismark actually introduced ""anti-socialist laws"" to limit their activity. The German SDP became the largest party in Germany in 1898 in terms of votes. There was also the Paris Commune of 1871 and a large growth of socialist figures in the French parliament. Socialism was most certainly popular well before Lenin was well known.",2

So again, the private economy is stagnating. There is nothing left to tax. The UK economy has grew a total of 5% in the last 15 years. The EU block is pretty much the same. 

If it was the case that economic growth was above 4% to pay for the NHS projected increases then sure, you could have kept it going for a while longer. 

The UK already has the highest taxes in has had in the last 70 years. Tax revenues are going down, not up. Investment in the UK is going down. 

The state has sucked all the marrow out of the private sector and now the state has to start eating itself to pay for its top entitlement programs.

8420,8420,13hlhko,">So again, the private economy is stagnating. There is nothing left to tax. The UK economy has grew a total of 5% in the last 15 years.

This is true but there's a huge amount of revenue in land values that isn't been taxed as I previously stated. The entire UK tax code is a mess, its a 10 million words mess in which we target labour and investment but not rents from capital or land. Of all the problems of the UK economy I'm not sure too much spending on welfare is a top priority (although I think you could argue that pension spending is too high currently and we need to look at that). 

&#x200B;

>The UK already has the highest taxes in has had in the last 70 years. Tax revenues are going down, not up. Investment in the UK is going down.

True, that's why we should implement full expensing, free up land use, remove tariffs and tax unearned rents. There's so much in the tax code i'd remove and reform I could talk for hours.

&#x200B;

>The state has sucked all the marrow out of the private sector and now the state has to start eating itself to pay for its top entitlement programs.

Well I'm strongly in favour of removing the state from lots of areas of the economy such as land use planning, barriers to entry in banking, licensing (not a huge problem in the UK but definitely in the US), shifting the tax burden from labour and investment onto rents, reforms to bureaucratic means tested welfare, removal of certain state restrictions on knowledge and liberalisation of patent laws, removal or rolling back state restrictions on labours ability to organise freely, removal or roll back of corporate subsidies as well as agriculture and fossil fuel subsidies. I wouldn't start with removing basic welfare measures for disabled people or healthcare for the sick - we can fund these things and grow the economy, we must first fix the tax code like I said not cut healthcare spending.

&#x200B;

>Cute. You had a Paris commune for an entire 2 months in the same respect that CHAZ existed for a few weeks. Socialism was a quirky thing before Lenin.

The Paris commune was one small example I gave, again the IWA had 8 million members and the German Marxist SDP was the largest party by vote share in 1898. The writings of Alexander Herzen who was well before Lenin was one of the key contributions that led to the emancipation of the serfs. There was also the 1905 revolution in Russia which was an attempt at a socialist revolution which had nothing to do with Lenin. I'm not even mentioning the history of socialism in Britain with the The Diggers or the Chartist movement (the movement which was a major part in leading to the establishment of political democracy in my country) and that was before Lenin was even born.

In fairness I am influenced by Georgist thinking and a tax on land (as well as on capital rents through a DBCFT and COST on IP) are great ideas I push for to tax rents. Again not a panacea hence why I also support things like NGDP futures targeting or free banking long term, removal of barriers to entry in banking, a negative income tax, land use planning reform, mutualisation and community control of sectors of the economy, profit-sharing and co-partnership in industry, repealing anti trade union laws, removal of corporate subsidies, free trade, local public/mutual banking.

Well I've studied tax policy in some depth at Uni for the past 3 years and I'm planning on doing Masters in public policy and I focus a lot on tax policy. I'm not an expert but I happen to be well educated on the matter.

The current tax code is riddled with cronyism, I think we can do better. The come back of ""why do you think you can do better"" is silly. I'm sure there are plenty of policies you support which aren't currently in place, it's not that you ""think you know better than everyone"" you just have opinions on policy and that's fine.

The government  providing the food, would probably result in them buying subpar food from the cheapest seller. I do think the government giving food vouchers to the poor and homeless, would probably be better.

How many of the people that ""care"" about the poor and homeless, would still care for them, if that meant paying higher taxes?

So is it an issue with people not caring, with not caring enough to pay higher taxes, or with it being too costly? And no, that's not a given. There are plenty of examples of people voting for those who raise taxes but provide government services in return. FDR would be one such example, but in general, Europe would like to say hello.

I agree with that, but social rights are far easier and cheaper to implement than something material, like a massive housing project.

Because bloating government bureaucracy is unnecessary, when we can just give people vouchers and let them get the food they want themselves.

My dietary preferences are my personal choice.  They don't impact other people.  I'm a steward in my lodge.  I cook eggs & bacon for the bretheren every time we have a stated.

Live and let live should be the rule for masons and vegans.  If a brother asks my reasons I'll tell them, but I'm not out to convert anybody.  Similarly, the Jews aren't trying to convert the Christians in my lodge or vice versa, and that's how it oughta be.

We vegans have a bad rep and it's a pain because just like Christians or skateboarders or any other group you want to pick -- we're not a monolith.  

In my lodge aprons are synthetic and so lambskin never enters into it, but the tools in a lodge are symbolic in nature and if they wanted to put a lambskin apron on me I would wear it.

As for the Scottish -- good on them for making a change which apparently they feel increases unity in their lodges.  It's a good decision for that reason alone, and also because they're not saying people can't use lambskin, they're simply providing the option for the lodge to choose.

That's a win for the subordinate lodges & some vegans.",4

If the GLoS changed it for other reasons, and vegans happen to benefit, great!

If the GLoS changed it because of social pressure from vegans, then I have an issue with that, for two reasons:

\#1. Grand Lodges, and individual lodges, are private organizations and don't need to bend their own rules to please society (assuming, of course, that those rules are moral and ethical, which they are). 

\#2. I don't care if you are white, black, purple, green, or yellow. I don't care if you eat meat, only eat vegetables, or are vegan. I've had/have friends that are all of the above. I'll still be your friend! Where I will become put off is when one of them pushes for changes in society that directly affect me because of their unique belief. If you want to be vegan, that's totally okay. But don't go around pushing for change and changing things that directly affect my life. That's like me forcing you to eat meat because I'm a huge fan of a good steak and believes that everyone should be eating [steaks.](https://steaks.It) It's like if you are religious or spiritual. I don't care what religion you are, I'll still be your friend! But don't force your religion on me or my kids. Same idea. I respect you and your beliefs, you respect me and my beliefs, and we'll all be friends.",3
8506,8506,evcx0t,"I think this may be just a case of a Grand Lodge trying to seize the opportunity of communicating on something they feel might make them look modern / with the times.

The problem with veganism is that it more sophisticated than it seems, and confuses/angers people to no end, specially those that do no have any interest in anything they perceive might remotely impact their habits or culture. They may even perceive people with animal right beliefs like snowflakes, completely detached from reality. There are different ""denominations"" of veganism. I mean - what are you supposed to do on haggis night - have a fake vegan haggis too?

Half the members of my Lodge eat like I do - vegan (whole foods plant based). We're a young Lodge. There really are some people that are questioning the usefulness or morality of eating or serving comfort/junk food at fraternal meals - or simply do not wish to eat heavy meals in the evening after the meeting.

But this is besides the point. Leather substitutes for aprons have been around for a very, very long time. 

It was perhaps in the Regulations or ritual of the GLoS that aprons must categorically be of leather - and recently changed that. Just like the trans-gender issue with the United Grand Lodge of England, they perhaps thought that publicly communicating on a theme like this would be a positive thing. In terms of the trans-gender issue - the UGLE was just obeying the law and modifying the Regulations to fit legal requirements.

Now had I not been allowed to join Freemasonry on the basis that I must wear a leather apron, that the apron must be of leather and not even a substitute, I might have said - the heck with you for being so silly.

All that being said - I'm only a vegan in terms of nutrition. More specifically, I only eat whole foods, plant based - which is significantly more strict than being a ""normal"" vegan. Technically, I am not a vegan. Coca cola is vegan, potato chips, are many meat or dairy substitutes that are vegan - and yet quite unhealthy. On the other side, I wear leather - shoes, belts, aprons. I do believe eating animals is normal - animals eat each other - it's just that we eat way too much animal products in general, of low quality and processed in a way that is extremely unhealthy.",3

8510,8510,evcx0t,"Let me prefix this by saying that I'm as far removed from the woke ""religion"" as you could possibly be.

Said that, I became a vegetarian when I left home, which was decades before it became a tool utilised to virtue-signal a form of moral superiority. I just didn't want extra animals being killed for my nourishment. In those days I was seen as a weirdo, and perhaps I was and still am.

However, it is my understanding that leather is a by-product of the meat industry. Animals like cows, pigs or sheep are generally not killed to get leather, they're slaughtered for food. What is left is used as a by-product.

My personal feelings about a lamb-skin apron are inconsequential. People eat a lot of lamb and whether what is left is used as a by-product or not does not make any difference to the number of lambs that are slaughtered.

In the big scheme of things, I doubt that the amount of vinyl used for aprons will be more than the proverbial drop in the ocean in our impact to the environment. However what I find baffling is, why going through the trouble of giving a vegan option for the apron (and join the virtue-signalling brigades by orchestrating a big publicity campaign), while that option is actually yet another polluting piece of plastic?",2

I personally believe that with the way the climate is going, it's fairly unethical to have a child just because I ""want"" one. I'm not the one who is going to be stuck here as it's rapidly getting worse. That's a can of worms in and of itself.

However, it shouldn't be that only people who can afford children should have them bc that's classist af.
There's enough technology and money and resources to go around, and if more people were educated and financially comfortable (which is why we have a government in this modern day & age, right? To manage the resources that make our lives easier?) then we could afford children without direct government dependency via welfare.

Another piece of advice - don't be a hero. Combat symptoms before they get out of control. If you have a headache, take an advil before it gets worse. If your knee hurts, ice it before it becomes a limp. it's a hell of a lot easier to treat symptoms before it gets unbearable. Pace yourself and rest.

i totally agree! i had similar arguments with my ex bc i would be like ""hey I'm having this issue with food and i need your help addressing it"" and he would just enable me and enable me; and so then by the time you bring it back up to them as an issue it feels so stupid that you're crying bc you can't not eat chips, you know? it made me like oddly proud that she was like ""okay but you know it's more than that right? do you hear me for real?""",38

If I'm remembering correctly as well, she had something called face threading done and it didn't go super well. It made her face with existing inflammation swell up even bigger. Someone can correct me on that if I'm wrong, but that's what I remembered. 

Also, if you see people with super round faces it possibly (not always, but possibly) means that they are on some type of steroid. It's called 'moon face.'",37

The whole time just felt like a treadmill going slightly too fast and just trying not to fly off the end. And I came from a pretty fucking privileged background; I can't even imagine what it's like without that. 

From 19-23 I developed heartburn, hair loss, weight gain, stress-related acne and dermatitis/eczema, general itchiness, canker sores, dandruff, ocular migraines, irregular periods, and sleep problems. I'd never had those before. 

It just came from working too much, not sleeping enough, moving all the time, not having the time/money to look after my diet, and living in really really crappy apartments in not super safe areas. 

Chronic stress will destroy you from the inside out. I only experienced it for about 3-4 years, but people live their whole lives like that. It really reiterated how much poverty puts people at a disadvantage. It's not talked about enough.

Honestly, I think if I had really worked harder on recovery as soon as it began flaring up it wouldn't be as bad as it is now.",1
8679,8679,ps0v1z,"I think suggestions would depend when you experience reflux. Do you have reflux episodes after eating and or when laying down? If so things that help with that are not eating 3 hours before bed, sleeping at an incline so gravity keeps stomach acid down, and sleeping on your left side because its longer on that side.

When you do have reflux, gaviscon advance the liquid is one of the best otc medicines. It creates a seal to stop the acid from causing more heartburn so keep that in mind.

If you are new to reflux I suggest making a food diary and see what foods are trigger foods for you and try to eat them in moderation or avoid entirely.",4

[Harvard Medical School - Foods that fight inflammation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation)

> Doctors are learning that one of the best ways to reduce inflammation lies not in the medicine cabinet, but in the refrigerator.  By following an anti-inflammatory diet you can fight off inflammation for good.

[Mayo Clinic - How to use food to help your body fight inflammation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/how-to-use-food-to-help-your-body-fight-inflammation/art-20457586)

> The choices you make at the grocery store can have an impact on the inflammation in your body. Scientists are still unraveling how food affects the body's inflammatory processes, but they know a few things.

> Research shows that what you eat can affect the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)—a marker for inflammation—in your blood. That could be because some foods like processed sugars help release inflammatory messengers that can raise the risk of chronic inflammation. Other foods like fruits and veggies help your body fight against oxidative stress, which can trigger inflammation.

There's a lot of information out there.

I don't have an opinion on Jaclyn, but inflammation is a real thing. Diets that help reduce inflammation are real. Just because you haven't heard of it before doesn't mean it's not real.",7

8717,8717,ps0v1z,"🤦🏻‍♀️ I don’t think it is anything but common sense that fruits and veggies are rich in nutrients and fried food is not.

However, weight loss and health can be achieved without cutting all desired foods out completely. 

When a medical diagnosis of chronic inflammation is a thing, please let me know.",6
8718,8718,ps0v1z,"I do really dislike Jaclyn! For many reasons. But will watch her from time to time out of curiosity.

I’ll wait for her to mention which autoimmune disorder she has, since this is about her, and will be waiting for a while, I imagine. If she were being treated for an autoimmune disorder, she’d be shouting from the rooftops.

Jaclyn doesn’t have to allude to vague health conditions to justify her vanity and being self-conscious. She’s a public figure in the beauty space with millions of followers. It’s not that hard to understand? A 60 day weight loss gimmick is NOT treatment for a medical issue.",2
8719,8719,ps0v1z,"Chronic inflammation is rarely a singular medical diagnosis, it's a symptom that is associated with many diseases (Chronic Inflammatory Diseases, or CIDs). It is unknown if chronic inflammation is a result of underlying conditions, or something that can lead to other diseases. 

[Harvard Medical School - Understanding acute and chronic inflammation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-acute-and-chronic-inflammation)

> There are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic. People are most familiar with acute inflammation. This is the redness, warmth, swelling, and pain around tissues and joints that occurs in response to an injury, like when you cut yourself. When the body is injured, your immune system releases white blood cells to surround and protect the area.

> ""Acute inflammation is how your body fights infections and helps speed up the healing process,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""In this way, inflammation is good because it protects the body."" This process works the same if you have a virus like a cold or the flu.

> In contrast, **when inflammation gets turned up too high and lingers for a long time, and the immune system continues to pump out white blood cells and chemical messengers that prolong the process, that's known as chronic inflammation.** ""From the body's perspective, it's under consistent attack, so the immune system keeps fighting indefinitely,"" says Dr. Shmerling.

> When this happens, white blood cells may end up attacking nearby healthy tissues and organs. For example, if you are overweight and have more visceral fat cells — the deep type of fat that surrounds your organs — the immune system may see those cells as a threat and attack them with white blood cells. The longer you are overweight, the longer your body can remain in a state of inflammation.

> Research has shown that **chronic inflammation is associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and bowel diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.**

> Yet, because chronic inflammation can continue for a long time, it's not easy to know its exact impact. ""It's a chicken-and-egg scenario,"" says Dr. Shmerling. **""Does chronic inflammation increase the risk of these ailments, or is it a byproduct? It is not always clear.""**

[Cleveland Clinic - Why You Should Pay Attention to Chronic Inflammation](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-you-should-pay-attention-to-chronic-inflammation/)

> Many people think of inflammation in terms of external signs: swelling, bruising and so on. **But in truth, uncontrolled inflammation plays a role in almost every major disease, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and even depression.**

> Inflammation occurs naturally in your body. **But when it goes wrong or goes on too long, it can trigger disease processes. That’s why researchers spend so much time trying to understand it — and developing ways to counteract it.**",7

8776,8776,13hli1l,"FDR thought so.  His 1944 State of the Union declared:

 We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. 

“Necessitous men are not free men.” People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.

In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all regardless of station, race, or creed.

Among these are:

The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation;

The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;

The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;

The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;

The right of every family to a decent home;

The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;

The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;

The right to a good education.

All of these rights spell security.  And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.",1

-“guaranteed” is vague. Eg, the US government does (to some extent) guarantee food access through SNAP, but it does so through subsidizing private provision. On the other hand, it guarantees health insurance to seniors through Medicare by direct public provision.

-what is being guaranteed is vague. Eg Medicare guarantees coverage but not *complete* coverage, leading some seniors to purchase private supplemental coverage.

-“what happens” in the markets for the things being guaranteed? Something else? (I have no idea what consumer power or marketing mischief you have in mind)",13

8802,8802,wt37o2,"well, I know it's a broad question, but I hoped you could give me some predictions of what might happens. It doesn't have to be completely accurate, just some speculation.

And by 'guaranteed' I obviously meant, people wouldn't have to worry about food, shelter or health care, what's so ever.

The reason I thought it would increase consumer power, is because currently 'losing a job' is big enough threat to many people, to be forced to put up with bad company practices.

It will also eliminate people worrying about things like food and shelter. Then they could start worrying about more long-term problems, and this way, society might progress faster. This will also mean, people won't be seeking jobs to earn their living, but because they want to work at that company. What would be the implications of that?

Although one bad outcome would be that the governing body would have so much power. And as governments usually do things in a centralized way, it would maybe make it easy to poison a huge population. Maybe it's not worth it. Well, what are your thoughts?

What if everyone had a machine that could extract or make the necessary nutrition from the air, for the body. But I wonder if it might be unsustainable and maybe many types of nutrition can't be made or extracted from the atmosphere.

As you can see I'm just speculating and that's all I'm asking of you too.",1

8804,8804,wt37o2,"In general, this sub is for answering specific questions with answers grounded in economics, not for engaging in wild speculation. We can answer this a bit though.

I do think that you missed the second bullet point. While the government can ensure that you’re nutritionally covered and sheltered, that doesn’t mean they’re guaranteeing you lobster dinners and mansions (that would be infeasible). The extent to which people want to achieve greater consumption and living standards motivates them to work more. (This is an answer you often see here in response to Keynes’s wrong prediction that by now we’d have 10 hour work-weeks: instead of choosing the same amount of consumption and less work, we’ve chosen the same amount of work and more consumption)

We do know something about the employment effects of unconditional cash welfare programs: [They’re small](https://home.uchicago.edu/~j1s/Jones_Alaska_2022.pdf). ([Here](www.marinescu.eu/publication/marinescu-no-2018/marinescu-no-2018.pdf) for a less technical literature review.)

Wages are also [surprisingly unresponsive to the value of exiting the labor force](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~schoefer/schoefer_files/Wages_Nonemployment_Final_QJE_Accepted.pdf) making your “consumer power” (really, “worker power”) story surprisingly unlikely (especially since the value of remaining employed is increasing also).

(Worth adding: Funding large transfer programs isn’t free, and the taxes required would be reasonably substantial, which might discourage work if loaded onto income taxation)",1
8805,8805,wt37o2,"They would definitely work some, because you still need money to buy many things. Plus not working would become a really bad social status, and people wouldn't want to mate with such people, and then evolution will do its thing.
But still I do wonder if people will do enough work to sustain the economy.",1

Please follow Rule I and don’t post wild unfounded speculation.",1
8807,8807,wt37o2,"What I'm hoping this will allow people to do is simply leave a job when they are dissatisfied with the company and look for another job. It will also increase risk-taking among entrepreneurs because they don't have to worry about losing money, they and their families will get food whether their business succeeds or not.
To make people still have a motivation to work, the government shouldn't provide too much, just the bare minimum. That's why it shouldn't subsidize anything else. 
I'm not sure what you meant by 'missed the second bullet point'. And thanks for answering my speculation anyway. I was looking for answers grounded in economics, or at least as grounded as the question allows. I don't know economics, so I wanted to see how this speculation of mine would map to economics where people actually study this stuff.",1
